| **Where do these forms map through? ** _Do they use Shift, Unite Digital, Autodata, etc?_                                                                                                                                                          | Shift                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Vehicles with a VOI or sales intent are mapped to Shift. All other are direct to dealer.                                                                                                                                                           |
| **Does this brand route credit apps through the OEM?** _If yes, please provide that mapping. Does this brand capture credit app info and how is that passed? Shift and dealer, Autodata only, etc_                                                 | Yes, Credit app leads are sent the same way all OEM leads for the program are sent.                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| DI --> Shift Digital --> Dealer                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| **What are the form testing requirements?** _What are their specific naming conventions or testing rules when we are testing leads or a new form. If there are not specific form testing requirements, please put “No form testing requirements.”_ | [MINI Test Leads](https://carscommerce.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/MINI/pages/2865596757) When submitting test leads for any BMW client, **THE FIRST NAME OF THE LEAD MUST BE OR INCLUDE THE WORD “TEST”!**  **Using 'test' WILL allow lead to get to dealer CRM** First Name: Test |

Last Name: \\[dealership_name\\]1  
Email: \\[dealership_name\\]1@[dealerinspire.com](http://dealerinspire.com/) |
| **Does this brand have any custom forms besides the core 1-16?** if yes, please provide the form title, provider ID, and mapping. _All sites go through development with the core #1-16 forms (Contact Us, Get E-Price, etc), does this brand have any specific forms that are required past these core 16? If so, what are they and how are they used on the site?_ | No |
| **Does this brand allow custom used lead routing? Please elaborate on if yes or no. Is this up to date?** [OEM ROUTING APPROVAL](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BZAqkFxH9KZCAP4wbXftBWUiaN-Swf1lb2ozno3fOfI/edit#gid=0) _Some dealers share inventory for multiple sites and they want routing to be updated based on inventory feeds._  
_For example, if a MINI site also has their BMW and CDJR inventory feeds, can we update routing on the non-oem feeds to route to their specific OEM’s and bypass the OEM? Or do ALL leads need to route to the OEM, regardless of brand or feed?_ | Yes

The lead routing sent to Shift should only equal the OEM Make. Any other model needs to go direct to the dealer. The OEM will not accept it. Note: Used vehicle requests that are not MINI will not be sent to Shift will route direct to dealer |
| **Does this brand have any custom form requirements/notes?** _Please provide clear details. Stellantis for example requires a zipcode field on all forms and this cannot be removed, does your brand have any similar requirements or rules we need to be aware of?_ | BMW and MINI both require TCPA and CCPA disclaimers on all of their lead forms if call or text is chosen as the preferred response. First name, last name, and email are all required fields on forms. |
| **Buy/Sell and forms** _How are forms tested or updated when a site goes through a buy/sell? Are live site updates allowed?_  
_When is a new dealer code activated based on the buy/sell sale?_  
_Anything else form specific to know about Buy/Sells?_ | Live site updates are required the day of the buy/sell. Leads, inventory, and tagging need to be updated no more than 24 hours after receiving the new dealer code. |
| **Additional Support Notes** | Contact Preference, Mobile Number, CCPA and TCPA fields are added by the plugin and cannot be removed MINI forms have the “Preferred Method of Contact” section added by default and this cannot be edited or removed. Used vehicle requests that are not MINI will not be sent to Shift, will route direct to dealer |
