| **Where do these forms map through? ** _Do they use Shift, Unite Digital, Autodata, etc?_ | Uses Lead Manifold, routing to MBUS |

Dealers opted into the MBUS Lead Program will send ONLY their DI sales leads to route through MBUS’s API, MBUS will then distribute the leads to the dealers CRM. Dealers opted out of the MBUS Lead Program: Leads are routed directly to the dealers' CRM or email as requested via the new MBUSA Direct Program. |
| **Can dealers opt out of lead routing?** | **This is considered mandatory for dealers enrolled, MBUS rarely gives opt-outs.**  
**They must work with the Leads Success Team to make adjustments via MB and dealers CRM for customizations.**  
**MBUS sends the leads to the dealers CRM through an API; therefore, if you need them to go to a different email address, that will need to be configured in the CRM.**

Mercedes Benz US routes Sales Lead Routing for New, Pre-Owned, CPO (All) leads on our sites through MBUS API. Some dealers opted out of this program (Fletcher Jones Groups, etc) Opt outs send the leads directly to the Dealers CRM. DI sales leads route to MBUS’s API, MBUS will then distribute the leads to the dealers CRM.  Some dealers have **NOT** signed the T3 leads agreement with MBUS and they will **NOT** be integrated into this lead API update. These dealers will continue to have all leads route directly into the dealers CRM. See list below: List of Opted Out Dealers: <custom data-

| **Does this brand allow custom used lead routing? Please elaborate on if yes or no. Is this up to date?** [OEM ROUTING APPROVAL](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BZAqkFxH9KZCAP4wbXftBWUiaN-Swf1lb2ozno3fOfI/edit#gid=0) _Some dealers share inventory for multiple sites and they want routing to be updated based on inventory feeds._  
_For example, if a MINI site also has their BMW and CDJR inventory feeds, can we update routing on the non-oem feeds to route to their specific OEM’s and bypass the OEM? Or do ALL leads need to route to the OEM, regardless of brand or feed?_ | No, all sales leads must route through the OEM. |
| **Does this brand have any custom form requirements/notes?** _Please provide clear details. Stellantis for example requires a zipcode field on all forms and this cannot be removed, does your brand have any similar requirements or rules we need to be aware of?_ | No |
| **Buy/Sell and forms** _How are forms tested or updated when a site goes through a buy/sell? Are live site updates allowed?_  
_When is a new dealer code activated based on the buy/sell sale?_  
_Anything else form specific to know about Buy/Sells?_ | MBUS does not generate a new Dealer Code until the completion of the Buy/Sell. Once that has concluded they send over a DBA change notice with the closure of the old store and opening of the new store with Dealer Codes included. Production should test leads routing, currently leads are sent directly to the dealers CRM. |
