| **Question**                                                                                                                                                                                       | **Answer**                                                |

| **Where do these forms map through? ** _Do they use Shift, Unite Digital, Autodata, etc?_                                                                                                          | Shift Digital                                             |
| **Does this brand route credit apps through the OEM?** _If yes, please provide that mapping. Does this brand capture credit app info and how is that passed? Shift and dealer, Autodata only, etc_ | No, the brand does not route credit apps through the OEM. |

| **What are the form testing requirements?** _What are their specific naming conventions or testing rules when we are testing leads_  
_or a new form. If there are not specific form testing requirements, please put “No form testing requirements.”_ | Sales Lead Vehicle Status = “new”, “used”, “cpo” Valid Year Valid Make Valid Model Customer First and Last Name Customer Email and/or Phone Number Valid Dealer Code and/or Zipcode Contact Empty Vehicle Tag = “<vehicle />” Customer First and Last Name Customer Email and/or Phone Number Valid Dealer Code and/or Zipcode |
| **Does this brand have any custom forms besides the core 1-16? if yes, please provide the form title, provider ID, and mapping.** _All sites go through development with the core #1-16 forms (Contact Us, Get E-Price, etc), does this brand have any specific forms that are required past these core 16? If so, what are they and how are they used on the site?_ | Please see the attached table for a full list of source IDs and forms  Ask a question (911) - Non-sales leads should go to Shift AND the dealer. Sales leads should route through Shift ONLY.  |
| **Additional Support Notes** | Name, Email, and Zip Code are required customer fields Maserati updated their mapping to be all shift and dealer EXCEPT for form id 10, which is shift only. |

If a lead from this list is not making it to the dealer, the correct course of action would be to loop in the Maserati Infobox alias ([info@maseratidealerdigital.com](mailto:info@maseratidealerdigital.com)) to investigate where the break in the lead flow might have happened. Please keep in mind that these are the leads that are required to be sent to Shift. If the dealer chooses to put a custom gravity form on their site, that is not required to be sent to Shift by default, however would be a good best practice to do so.
