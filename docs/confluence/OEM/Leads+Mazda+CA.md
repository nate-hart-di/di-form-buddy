| **Where do these forms map through? ** _Do they use Shift, Unite Digital, Autodata, etc?_ | Shift - All leads are Shift and Dealer. Any New, Used, or Certified Vehicle sales leads will be sent only to Shift Digital as outlined in the following |

document. The website provider will be responsible for delivering any non-sale specific leads (service, parts,  
general contact, etc.) to both Shift Digital and the dealer. |
| **Does this brand route credit apps through the OEM?** _If yes, please provide that mapping. Does this brand capture credit app info and how is that passed? Shift and dealer, Autodata only, etc_ | Credit apps on dealer websites route directly to the dealership. Shift does not capture customer/lead information. The data that gets shared to the OEM is lead response data, not customer info. |
| **What are the form testing requirements?** _What are their specific naming conventions or testing rules when we are testing leads_  
_or a new form. If there are not specific form testing requirements, please put “No form testing requirements.”_ | Depends on the dealer's CRM. If the dealer's CRM can't accept TEST or something, we'd have to align with that. |
| **Does this brand have any custom forms besides the core 1-16?** if yes, please provide the form title, provider ID, and mapping. _All sites go through development with the core #1-16 forms (Contact Us, Get E-Price, etc), does this brand have any specific forms that are required past these core 16? If so, what are they and how are they used on the site?_ | No at this ti

mple, if a MINI site also has their BMW and CDJR inventory feeds, can we update routing on the non-oem feeds to route to their specific OEM’s and bypass the OEM? Or do ALL leads need to route to the OEM, regardless of brand or feed?\_ | No, informaiton not provided. 

Forms are mapped as shift and dealer so should be ok |
| **Does this brand have any custom form requirements/notes?** _Please provide clear details. Stellantis for example requires a zipcode field on all forms and this cannot be removed, does your brand have any similar requirements or rules we need to be aware of?_ | Not at this time.  |
| **Buy/Sell and forms** _How are forms tested or updated when a site goes through a buy/sell? Are live site updates allowed?_  
_When is a new dealer code activated based on the buy/sell sale?_  
_Anything else form specific to know about Buy/Sells?_ | Yes, live site updates are allowed. Yes, we do need the new dealer code. Nothing else special about buy/sells other than to wait for the enrollment and go ahead from Shift/Mazda before we relaunch the site |
| **Additional Support Notes** | Currently all leads for the Mazda CA Program are either Shift and Dealer or Dealer Only.  This setup is due in part to routing issues discovered by Shift Digital and SCI (the once-expected) CRM for the Mazda CA program. _At this time, the ADF email notification you put in the backend of the site WILL affect what is passed on to the dealer (contrary to several of our other OEM programs)._ If your dealer is using SCI as a CRM, please be advised that any small change to a form, adding a new form or changing the name of the form can cause the form to be rejected by SCI.  This rejection will not allow SCI to pass the form to the dealer's CRM. If there is to be a new form created, or a new source on a website, please loop in the Program Manager and she will reach out to SCI to begin the mapping process.  This is not an instant process and will take several days.  This should be communicated to the dealer. |
