| **Does this brand allow custom used lead routing? Please elaborate on if yes or no. Is this up to date?** [OEM ROUTING APPROVAL](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BZAqkFxH9KZCAP4wbXftBWUiaN-Swf1lb2ozno3fOfI/edit#gid=0)  
_Some dealers share inventory for multiple sites and they want routing to be updated based on inventory feeds._  
_For example, if a MINI site also has their BMW and CDJR inventory feeds, can we update routing on the non-oem feeds to route to their specific OEM’s and bypass the OEM? Or do ALL leads need to route to the OEM, regardless of brand or feed?_ | technically could parse out the leads to also send directly to dealer if they are used vehicles, as long as leads are also delivered to shift |
| **Does this brand have any custom form requirements/notes?**  
_Please provide clear details. Stellantis for example requires a zipcode field on all forms and this cannot be removed, does your brand have any similar requirements or rules we need to be aware of?_ | All sales leads, service and contact us forms need to be sent to Shift |

_When is a new dealer code activated based on the buy/sell sale?_  
_Anything else form specific to know about Buy/Sells?_ | Same testing as site go-live.  |
