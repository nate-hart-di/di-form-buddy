| **Where do these forms map through?** _Do they use Shift, Unite Digital, Autodata, etc?_                                                                                                           | **For Non-SmartPath Toyota Dealers:** Leads go directly to the dealer. Leads are not sent to Shift Digital or Toyota. Shift used Urban Science for lead tracking / data gathering; we have code implemented on our Toyota OEM sites for this and are notified of any issues. This includes implementation with our prod engineering team for Conversations and OS.  **For SmartPath Toyota Dealers:** The Unlock Smart Price, Estimate Payments and Check Availability CTAs on a SmartPath site route to the SmartPath microsite and are sent by Toyota to the CRM. Dealer Inspire does not handle any lead routing for these leads. |
| **Does this brand route credit apps through the OEM?** _If yes, please provide that mapping. Does this brand capture credit app info and how is that passed? Shift and dealer, Autodata only, etc_ | No - except maybe through their SmartPath microsite straight to the Toyota CRM, which would not involve us at this time.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

| **What are the form testing requirements?** _What are their specific naming conventions or testing rules when we are testing leads_  
_or a new form. If there are not specific form testing requirements, please put “No form testing requirements.”_ | There are no form testing requirements unless notified by Toyota TDDS Program that we need a global update or something with our code has been interrupted. At that time, they will provide directions on if any testing is needed.  We do not do form testing on individual dealer webs

y and how are they used on the site?_ | Standardized Forms:  [https://share.getcloudapp.com/6quwXon1](https://share.getcloudapp.com/6quwXon1) Online Shopper & Conversations provider IDs: [https://share.getcloudapp.com/z8udBo2q](https://share.getcloudapp.com/z8udBo2q) For chats related to trade ins, we use 1081 for that ID |
| **What is the mapping ID and mapping type for each form?** \_For example, are the forms mapped as shift and dealer? Dealer only?_ | See above for mapping on each form - this is already set up on a program level - forms are mapped to dealer only.  |
| **Does this brand allow custom used lead routing? Please elaborate on if yes or no. Is this up to date?** [**OEM ROUTING APPROVAL**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BZAqkFxH9KZCAP4wbXftBWUiaN-Swf1lb2ozno3fOfI/edit#gid=0) _Some dealers share inventory for multiple sites and they want routing to be updated based on inventory feeds._  
_For example, if a MINI site also has their BMW and CDJR inventory feeds, can we update routing on the non-oem feeds to route to their specific OEM’s and bypass the OEM? Or do ALL leads need to route to the OEM, regardless of brand or feed?_ | SmartPath leads must go to the Toyota CRM but they only care about New vehicles; Non SmartPath leads go straight to dealer and can used lead routing is allowed.  |
| **Does this brand have any custom form requirements/notes?** _Please provide clear details. Stellantis for example requires a zipcode field on all forms and this cannot be removed, does your brand have any similar requirements or rules we need to be aware of?_ | No - but for custom program pages they sometimes request a custom form with a VOI. (They provide spec details for those instances) |
| **Buy/Sell and forms** _How are forms tested or updated when a site goes through a buy/sell? Are live site updates allowed?_  
_When is a new dealer code activated based on the buy/sell sale?_  
_Anything else form specific to know about Buy/Sells?_ | We do not test forms on the program side. |
