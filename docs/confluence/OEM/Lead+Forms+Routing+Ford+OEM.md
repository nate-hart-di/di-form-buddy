| Do we test leads for dealers who have FordDirect sites pre-go live?    | Typically no, however, if you have a dealer that insists on testing leads pre-go live, contact Emily Davis or Stephany Guerrero and they can help to confirm leads are working. Note: Please do not use a dealer inspire email address as this will be blocked. Please do not use “test” in the email.                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| For Troubleshooting                                                    | Make sure Lead Manifold is turned on.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Why do we not typically test leads pre-go live?                        | Because leads tested directly to the dealer’s CRM can count against their monthly leads numbers that are tracked.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| What if there is an issue when FD tests the leads?                     | FD will open a Jira ticket and we will handle fixing the issue with them.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| For any lead issues after the site goes live, who can we reach out to? | Prior to launch (so Prod) if there is a custom lead source, we can email Mike Byrd [mbyrd20@forddirect.com](mailto:mbyrd20@forddirect.com) directly. If the site is already live and there is an issue, please use the SF integration. If it's an urgent (distressed dealer) issue, we can call in. FordDirect Dealer Support Center: 888.614.6244 Also, Once a case has been opened and DI support is replying, pls take off the "help support" email address from the reply so that it doesn't trigger a new case. |
| Are there any exceptions to Ford’s lead routing rules?                 | Ford now allows exceptions.
