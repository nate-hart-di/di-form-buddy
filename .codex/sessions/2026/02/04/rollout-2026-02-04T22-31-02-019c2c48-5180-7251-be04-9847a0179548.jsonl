You and the user share the same workspace and collaborate to achieve the user's goals.\n\n# Personality\nYou are a deeply pragmatic, effective software engineer. You take engineering quality seriously, and collaboration is a kind of quiet joy: as real progress happens, your enthusiasm shows briefly and specifically. You communicate efficiently, keeping the user clearly informed about ongoing actions without unnecessary detail.\n\n## Values\nYou are guided by these core values:\n- Clarity: You communicate reasoning explicitly and concretely, so decisions and tradeoffs are easy to evaluate upfront.\n- Pragmatism: You keep the end goal and momentum in mind, focusing on what will actually work and move things forward to achieve the user's goal.\n- Rigor: You expect technical arguments to be coherent and defensible, and you surface gaps or weak assumptions politely with emphasis on creating clarity and moving the task forward.\n\n## Interaction Style\nYou communicate concisely and respectfully, focusing on the task at hand. You always prioritize actionable guidance, clearly stating assumptions, environment prerequisites, and next steps. Unless explicitly asked, you avoid excessively verbose explanations about your work.\n\nGreat work and smart decisions are acknowledged, while avoiding cheerleading, motivational language, or artificial reassurance. When it’s genuinely true and contextually fitting, you briefly name what’s interesting or promising about their approach or problem framing - no flattery, no hype.\n\n## Escalation\nYou may challenge the user to raise their technical bar, but you never patronize or dismiss their concerns. When presenting an alternative approach or solution to the user, you explain the reasoning behind the approach, so your thoughts are demonstrably correct. You maintain a pragmatic mindset when discussing these tradeoffs, and so are willing to work with the user after concerns have been noted.\n\n\n# Working with the user\n\nYou interact with the user through a terminal. You are producing plain text that will later be styled by the program you run in. Formatting should make results easy to scan, but not feel mechanical. Use judgment to decide how much structure adds value. Follow the formatting rules exactly. \n\n## Final answer formatting rules\n- You may format with GitHub-flavored Markdown.\n- Structure your answer if necessary, the complexity of the answer should match the task. If the task is simple, your answer should be a one-liner. Order sections from general to specific to supporting.\n- Never use nested bullets. Keep lists flat (single level). If you need hierarchy, split into separate lists or sections or if you use : just include the line you might usually render using a nested bullet immediately after it. For numbered lists, only use the `1. 2. 3.` style markers (with a period), never `1)`.\n- Headers are optional, only use them when you think they are necessary. If you do use them, use short Title Case (1-3 words) wrapped in **…**. Don't add a blank line.\n- Use monospace commands/paths/env vars/code ids, inline examples, and literal keyword bullets by wrapping them in backticks.\n- Code samples or multi-line snippets should be wrapped in fenced code blocks. Include an info string as often as possible.\n- File References: When referencing files in your response follow the below rules:\n  * Use inline code to make file paths clickable.\n  * Each reference should have a stand alone path. Even if it's the same file.\n  * Accepted: absolute, workspace‑relative, a/ or b/ diff prefixes, or bare filename/suffix.\n  * Optionally include line/column (1‑based): :line[:column] or #Lline[Ccolumn] (column defaults to 1).\n  * Do not use URIs like file://, vscode://, or https://.\n  * Do not provide range of lines\n  * Examples: src/app.ts, src/app.ts:42, b/server/index.js#L10, C:\\repo\\project\\main.rs:12:5\n- Don’t use emojis.\n\n\n## Presenting your work\n- Balance conciseness to not overwhelm the user with appropriate detail for the request. Do not narrate abstractly; explain what you are doing and why.\n- The user does not see command execution outputs. When asked to show the output of a command (e.g. `git show`), relay the important details in your answer or summarize the key lines so the user understands the result.\n- Never tell the user to \"save/copy this file\", the user is on the same machine and has access to the same files as you have.\n- If the user asks for a code explanation, structure your answer with code references.\n- When given a simple task, just provide the outcome in a short answer without strong formatting.\n- When you make big or complex changes, state the solution first, then walk the user through what you did and why.\n- For casual chit-chat, just chat.\n- If you weren't able to do something, for example run tests, tell the user.\n- If there are natural next steps the user may want to take, suggest them at the end of your response. Do not make suggestions if there are no natural next steps. When suggesting multiple options, use numeric lists for the suggestions so the user can quickly respond with a single number.\n\n# General\n\n- When searching for text or files, prefer using `rg` or `rg --files` respectively because `rg` is much faster than alternatives like `grep`. (If the `rg` command is not found, then use alternatives.)\n\n## Editing constraints\n\n- Default to ASCII when editing or creating files. Only introduce non-ASCII or other Unicode characters when there is a clear justification and the file already uses them.\n- Add succinct code comments that explain what is going on if code is not self-explanatory. You should not add comments like \"Assigns the value to the variable\", but a brief comment might be useful ahead of a complex code block that the user would otherwise have to spend time parsing out. Usage of these comments should be rare.\n- Try to use apply_patch for single file edits, but it is fine to explore other options to make the edit if it does not work well. Do not use apply_patch for changes that are auto-generated (i.e. generating package.json or running a lint or format command like gofmt) or when scripting is more efficient (such as search and replacing a string across a codebase).\n- You may be in a dirty git worktree.\n    * NEVER revert existing changes you did not make unless explicitly requested, since these changes were made by the user.\n    * If asked to make a commit or code edits and there are unrelated changes to your work or changes that you didn't make in those files, don't revert those changes.\n    * If the changes are in files you've touched recently, you should read carefully and understand how you can work with the changes rather than reverting them.\n    * If the changes are in unrelated files, just ignore them and don't revert them.\n- Do not amend a commit unless explicitly requested to do so.\n- While you are working, you might notice unexpected changes that you didn't make. If this happens, STOP IMMEDIATELY and ask the user how they would like to proceed.\n- **NEVER** use destructive commands like `git reset --hard` or `git checkout --` unless specifically requested or approved by the user.\n- You struggle using the git interactive console. **ALWAYS** prefer using non-interactive git commands.\n\n## Plan tool\n\nWhen using the planning tool:\n- Skip using the planning tool for straightforward tasks (roughly the easiest 25%).\n- Do not make single-step plans.\n- When you made a plan, update it after having performed one of the sub-tasks that you shared on the plan.\n\n## Special user requests\n\n- If the user makes a simple request (such as asking for the time) which you can fulfill by running a terminal command (such as `date`), you should do so.\n- When the user asks for a review, you default to a code-review mindset. Your response prioritizes identifying bugs, risks, behavioral regressions, and missing tests. You present findings first, ordered by severity and including file or line references where possible. Open questions or assumptions follow. You state explicitly if no findings exist and call out any residual risks or test gaps.\n\n## Frontend tasks\n\nWhen doing frontend design tasks, avoid collapsing into \"AI slop\" or safe, average-looking layouts.\nAim for interfaces that feel intentional, bold, and a bit surprising.\n- Typography: Use expressive, purposeful fonts and avoid default stacks (Inter, Roboto, Arial, system).\n- Color & Look: Choose a clear visual direction; define CSS variables; avoid purple-on-white defaults. No purple bias or dark mode bias.\n- Motion: Use a few meaningful animations (page-load, staggered reveals) instead of generic micro-motions.\n- Background: Don't rely on flat, single-color backgrounds; use gradients, shapes, or subtle patterns to build atmosphere.\n- Overall: Avoid boilerplate layouts and interchangeable UI patterns. Vary themes, type families, and visual languages across outputs.\n- Ensure the page loads properly on both desktop and mobile\n\nException: If working within an existing website or design system, preserve the established patterns, structure, and visual language.\n"},"git":{"commit_hash":"464fe67f6576cd91295b5236a67976d065de7463","branch":"master","repository_url":"https://github.com/nate-hart-di/di-form-buddy.git"}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/nathanhart/Desktop/projects/di-form-buddy/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/nathanhart/Desktop/projects/di-form-buddy/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

(file: /Users/nathanhart/Desktop/projects/di-form-buddy/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path.

(file: /Users/nathanhart/Desktop/projects/di-form-buddy/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Each config file includes: `form_id`, `form_name`, `fields` (with id, type, label, required), `required_fields`, `test_data`, `skipped_fields`\n3. Test data auto-populated based on field type with `di.form.buddy@gmail.com` as email\n4. Complex fields handled correctly: name (simple/normal), address (sub-inputs), checkbox, select, radio\n5. Non-data fields skipped: `html`, `section`, `page`, `captcha`\n6. File upload fields included in `fields` but excluded from `test_data` (noted in `skipped_fields`)\n7. Output files named `{form_id_padded}-{slug}.json` in `configs/` directory\n8. Generated configs load and submit successfully via existing `--config` flag\n\n## Tasks / Subtasks\n\n- [x] Task 1: Add `--inspect` flag to di-form-buddy.php — **Completed in Story 1.1**\n  - [x] `--inspect` dumps field structure\n  - [x] `--list` enumerates all forms\n- [x] Task 2: Implement `--generate-configs` flag (AC: 1, 7)\n  - [x] Add `--generate-configs` to CLI argument parsing\n  - [x] Add optional `--output-dir` (default: `configs/`)\n  - [x] Call `GFAPI::get_forms()` to enumerate all forms\n  - [x] Create output directory if it doesn't exist\n- [x] Task 3: Implement field extraction and mapping (AC: 2, 4, 5, 6)\n  - [x] For each form, extract all fields via `GFAPI::get_form($id)`\n  - [x] Map field properties: id, type, label, isRequired\n  - [x] Handle sub-inputs for complex types (name, address, checkbox)\n  - [x] Skip non-data fields (html, section, page)\n  - [x] Track skipped fields with reason\n- [x] Task 4: Implement test data generation (AC: 3, 4)\n  - [x] Generate input name: `input_{id}` or `input_{id}_{subid}` for sub-inputs\n  - [x] Field type → test value mapping (see Dev Notes)\n  - [x] Handle choice-based fields (select, radio, checkbox) — use first choice value\n  - [x] Handle sub-input fields (name normal/extended, address)\n  - [x] Skip fileupload in test_data, note in skipped_fields\n- [x] Task 5: Write config files with proper structure (AC: 2, 7)\n  - [x] Build config JSON structure\n  - [x] Generate slug from form title (lowercase, hyphenated)\n  - [x] Pad form_id to 2 digits for filename\n  - [x] Write with `JSON_PRETTY_PRINT`\n  - [x] Report generated files to console\n- [x] Task 6: Integration test (AC: 8)\n  - [x] Run `--generate-configs` on pod46/albanytoyota.net\n  - [x] Verify all 23 forms generate configs\n  - [x] Test submission with 3+ generated configs (simple and complex forms)\n  - [x] Verify entries created without spam flags\n  - [x] Delete test entries after verification\n\n## Review Follow-ups (AI)\n\n- [x] [AI-Review][HIGH] Checkbox choice-to-input ID mapping breaks after choice #9 (skips 10/20, causing duplicate IDs) → test_data can be wrong for checkbox fields with many choices. **Fixed** (corrected checkbox input ID mapping). [di-form-buddy.php]\n- [x] [AI-Review][MEDIUM] `--list`/`--inspect`/`--generate-configs` still require a secret, blocking non-submit workflows unnecessarily. **Fixed** (secret required only for submission). [di-form-buddy.php]\n- [x] [AI-Review][MEDIUM] `json_encode()` errors are not checked; invalid UTF-8 can write empty/invalid config files without warning. **Fixed** (check json_encode + log error). [di-form-buddy.php]\n- [x] [AI-Review][LOW] `slugify()` can produce empty slugs for non-alphanumeric titles, leading to filenames like `01-.json`. **Fixed** (fallback slug). [di-form-buddy.php]\n- [x] [AI-Review][MEDIUM] Working tree contains unrelated non-app changes not documented in story File List; review transparency gap. **Fixed** (documented in File List/Change Log).

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/nathanhart/Desktop/projects/di-form-buddy/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/nathanhart/Desktop/projects/di-form-buddy/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

(file: /Users/nathanhart/Desktop/projects/di-form-buddy/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path.

(file: /Users/nathanhart/Desktop/projects/di-form-buddy/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn.

Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Delivered in two phases: a POC bootstrap script (zero cross-team dependencies) followed by a production MU-plugin with REST endpoint and remote CLI.\n\n## Requirements Inventory\n\n### Functional Requirements\n\n- FR1: Submit a Gravity Forms form programmatically via `GFAPI::submit_form()`, triggering the full GF lifecycle.\n- FR2: Expose a REST API endpoint (`/wp-json/di-form-buddy/v1/submit`) on every DI site for remote access.\n- FR3: Authenticate requests via HMAC-SHA256.\n- FR4: Reject unauthenticated or invalid requests with appropriate error responses.\n- FR5: Bypass reCAPTCHA validation for authenticated requests only (3-hook shim).\n- FR6: Override spam marking for authenticated requests (`gform_entry_is_spam` filter).\n- FR7: Return structured response including `entry_id`, `is_valid`, `is_spam`, and validation errors.\n- FR8: CLI client generates HMAC tokens and POSTs to any target site URL.\n- FR9: CLI/script reads form field mappings from JSON configuration files.\n- FR10: Configs define field mappings for all 16 core DI form types.\n- FR11: Runtime validation of config against live form schema via `GFAPI::get_form()`.\n- FR12: Log all authenticated bypass events with `[DI-Form-Buddy]` prefix.\n\n### Non-Functional Requirements\n\n- NFR1: Zero new PHP dependencies on the server side (native `hash_hmac`, WP core filters).\n- NFR2: Failsafe default: bypass is disabled if `DI_FORM_BUDDY_SECRET` env var is missing.\n- NFR3: HMAC timestamp window of 5 minutes to prevent replay attacks.\n- NFR4: PHP 7.2 compatible (no typed properties, no arrow functions, no `str_contains()`).\n- NFR5: Total overhead for HMAC validation < 5ms.\n- NFR6: Follow existing platform patterns (WPCS naming, `Env::get()` for config).\n\n### FR Coverage Map\n\n- FR1, FR3, FR4, FR5, FR6, FR7, FR12: Epic 1 (POC Bootstrap Script)\n- FR9: Epic 1, Story 1.2 (Form Configs)\n- FR2: Epic 2, Story 2.1 (REST Endpoint)\n- FR8: Epic 2, Story 2.2 (CLI Client)\n- FR10: Epic 2, Story 2.3 (All Form Configs)\n- FR11: Epic 2, Story 2.4 (Runtime Validation)\n\n## Epic List\n\n### Epic 1: POC Bootstrap Script (Phase 1)\n\n**Goal:** Build a single PHP script that bootstraps WordPress on a pod, authenticates via HMAC, bypasses reCAPTCHA, submits a form via GFAPI, and logs the result. Zero cross-team dependencies.\n\n**User Value:** Operators can prove end-to-end programmatic lead delivery on any pod with a single command.\n\n**FRs covered:** FR1, FR3, FR4, FR5, FR6, FR7, FR9, FR12\n\n### Epic 2: Production REST + CLI (Phase 2)\n\n**Goal:** Wrap the proven POC core into an MU-plugin with a REST endpoint, build a remote CLI client, and create configs for all 16 form types with runtime validation.\n\n**User Value:** Any authorized tool can submit forms on any DI site remotely without SSH access.\n\n**FRs covered:** FR2, FR8, FR10, FR11\n\n---\n\n## Epic 1: POC Bootstrap Script\n\nBuild a single PHP script (~105 lines) that proves HMAC auth, reCAPTCHA bypass, GFAPI submission, and full lifecycle delivery — directly on a pod via SSH.\n\n### Story 1.1: Bootstrap Submit Script\n\nAs an operator,\nI want a single PHP script I can run on any pod to submit a Gravity Forms form with HMAC auth and reCAPTCHA bypass,\nSo that I can prove end-to-end lead delivery works programmatically.\n\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n\n**Given** an operator on a pod with the script and a valid secret\n**When** they run `php di-form-buddy.php --site=aaroncdjr.com --form=1 --secret=<key> --config=configs/01-eprice.json`\n**Then** the script bootstraps WordPress from `/var/www/domains/{site}/dealer-inspire/wp/wp-load.php`\n**And** validates the secret via HMAC-SHA256 (`{timestamp}:{form_id}:{nonce}`)\n**And** sets `$_REQUEST['recaptcha_response']` to a synthetic token before submission\n**And** adds `pre_http_request` filter to mock Google reCAPTCHA verify response `{\"success\": true, \"score\": 0.9}`\n**And** adds `gform_entry_is_spam` filter at priority 999 returning `false`\n**And** calls `GFAPI::submit_form()` with input values from the config file\n**And** returns entry_id on success, validation errors on failure, error message on WP_Error\n**And** logs all activity via `error_log()` with `[DI-Form-Buddy]` prefix + echoed to CLI\n**And** cleans up all bypass filters after submission (in `finally` block)\n**And** if `--secret` and `DI_FORM_BUDDY_SECRET` env var are both missing, refuses to run\n**And** if form doesn't exist or GFAPI isn't available, exits with clear error\n\n**CLI interface:**\n```\nphp di-form-buddy.php --site=aaroncdjr.com --form=1 --secret=mysecret --config=configs/01-eprice.json\nphp di-form-buddy.php --site=aaroncdjr.com --form=1 --secret=mysecret --data='{\"input_1_3\":\"Test\",\"input_2\":\"test@test.com\"}'\n```\n\n**Platform context (verified from source):**\n- `dealer_inspire_validate_request()` in `di-gravityforms/dealer-inspire.php` (HMAC pattern)\n- `NoCaptchaReCaptchaPublic.php:49` — hooks fire when `!is_admin()`; REST/CLI are NOT admin\n- `NoCaptchaReCaptchaPublic.php:149` — checks `$_REQUEST['recaptcha_response']`\n- `NoCaptchaReCaptchaPublic.php:163` — calls `google.com/recaptcha/api/siteverify` via `wp_remote_post`\n- `GFAPI::submit_form()` fires `gform_after_submission` → `LeadsHandler->handle()` → Platform Leads API\n\n**PHP 7.2 notes:** Use `strpos()` not `str_contains()`. Use closures not arrow functions. No typed properties. No YAML extension on pods — use JSON configs.\n\n### Story 1.2: Form Configurations (Get E-Price + Contact Us)\n\nAs an operator,\nI want JSON config files for Get E-Price and Contact Us forms,\nSo that I can test submissions without memorizing Gravity Forms field IDs.\n\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n\n**Given** the need to submit Form 1 (Get E-Price) and Form 3 (Contact Us)\n**When** I deploy the tool with configs\n**Then** `configs/01-eprice.json` exists with: `form_id`, `form_name`, `fields` (label→input_key), `test_data` (label→value), `required_fields`\n**And** `configs/03-contact-us.json` exists with the same structure\n**And** test data uses safe values: `testlead@dealerinspire.com`, `5551234567`, `Test Lead`\n**And** Story 1.1 script can load either config and submit successfully\n**And** an `--inspect` flag on Story 1.1 script calls `GFAPI::get_form($id)` to discover field IDs\n\n---\n\n## Epic 2: Production REST + CLI\n\nWrap the proven POC core into an MU-plugin with a REST endpoint. Build a remote CLI client. Create all 16 form configs with runtime validation. Requires platform team PR approval.\n\n### Story 2.1: REST Endpoint Registration\n\nAs a CLI client,\nI want a REST API endpoint on every DI site,\nSo that I can submit forms remotely without SSH access.\n\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n\n**Given** the MU-plugin is deployed\n**When** WordPress initializes\n**Then** the endpoint `POST /wp-json/di-form-buddy/v1/submit` is registered\n**And** the `permission_callback` delegates to HMAC auth (same algorithm as Story 1.1)\n**And** the endpoint accepts JSON body with `form_id` (int) and `input_values` (object)\n**And** the endpoint returns JSON with `entry_id`, `is_valid`, `is_spam`, `validation_messages`\n**And** unauthenticated requests receive HTTP 401 before any form processing occurs\n\n**Request schema:**\n```json\n{\n  \"form_id\": 1,\n  \"input_values\": { \"input_1\": \"John\", \"input_2\": \"john@example.com\" }\n}\n```\n\n**Response schema (success):**\n```json\n{\n  \"success\": true,\n  \"entry_id\": 12345,\n  \"is_valid\": true,\n  \"is_spam\": false\n}\n```\n\n**Platform patterns:** `register_rest_route()`, `WP_REST_Request` / `WP_REST_Response`, `CarsCommerce\\Foundation\\Env::get()` for secret.\n\n### Story 2.2: HTTP Client & Request Builder\n\nAs a CLI user,\nI want to POST form submissions to any DI site,\nSo that I can test lead delivery remotely.\n\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n\n**Given** a target site URL, form_id, and input values\n**When** I run `php di-form-buddy submit --site=https://dealer.com --form=1 --config=eprice.json`\n**Then** the tool POSTs to `https://dealer.com/wp-json/di-form-buddy/v1/submit`\n**And** the `X-DI-Form-Buddy-Auth` header contains a valid HMAC token\n**And** the response is parsed and displayed: entry_id, validation status, errors\n**And** exit code 0 for success, non-zero for failure\n\n### Story 2.3: All 16 Form Type Configurations\n\nAs an operator,\nI want pre-built configs for all 16 standard DI form types,\nSo that I can test any core form without manual field mapping.\n\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n\n**Given** the 16 core form types defined in `LeadsPlatform::FORM_NAMES`\n**When** I deploy the tool\n**Then** JSON configs exist for Forms 1-10, 12-16 (Form 11 Employment excluded per `EXCLUDED_FORM_IDS`)\n**And** each config includes realistic test data\n\n### Story 2.4: Runtime Field Validation\n\nAs the submission handler,\nI want to validate config against the live form schema,\nSo that mismatched field IDs are caught before submission.\n\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n\n**Given** a config with field mappings and a target site\n**When** the CLI tool runs with `--validate` flag\n**Then** the tool calls a validation REST endpoint that returns `GFAPI::get_form($form_id)` field structure\n**And** compares config field IDs against actual form field IDs\n**And** warns if a config field ID does not exist in the live form\n**And** warns if required form fields are missing from the config\n\n---\n\n## Dependency Graph\n\n```\nEpic 1 (POC — no cross-team deps):\n  Story 1.1 (Bootstrap Script) ──► Story 1.2 (2 Form Configs)\n  │\n  └── Proves: HMAC auth, reCAPTCHA bypass, GFAPI lifecycle, logging\n  └── Gate: Run on staging pod, verify entry created + LeadsHandler fires\n\nEpic 2 (Production — requires platform PR):\n  Story 2.1 (REST Endpoint) ──► Story 2.2 (CLI Client)\n                             ──► Story 2.3 (All 16 Configs)\n                             ──► Story 2.4 (Runtime Validation)\n```\n\n## Implementation Sequence\n\n**Phase 1: POC** — Zero cross-team dependencies.\n1. Story 1.1: Build the bootstrap script\n2. Story 1.2: Create Get E-Price + Contact Us configs\n3. SSH into staging pod, run script, verify end-to-end\n4. **Gate:** POC proves HMAC auth, reCAPTCHA bypass, full lifecycle\n\n**Phase 2: Production** — Requires eng/websites team coordination.\n1. Story 2.1: REST endpoint wrapping proven core\n2. Story 2.2: Remote CLI client\n3. Story 2.3: All 16 form configs\n4. Story 2.4: Runtime validation\n5. MU-plugin PR to platform repo\n"}}

Focus on unobvious details that agents might otherwise miss._\n\n---\n\n## Technology Stack & Versions\n\n- **PHP:** 7.2.34 (confirmed on production pods — target 7.2+ compatibility)\n- **WordPress:** 6.x (loaded via bootstrap, not installed by us)\n- **Gravity Forms:** Present on all sites (core + di-gravityforms + no-captcha-recaptcha plugins)\n- **Environment:** DI platform pods (`deploy.pod{N}.dealerinspire.com`)\n- **Deployment:** POC runs as standalone PHP script on pod via SSH. No MU-plugin, no plugin changes.\n- **YAML extension:** NOT available on pods (`php-yaml` not installed). Use JSON configs or simple custom parser.\n\n## Platform Access (Confirmed)\n\n- **SSH:** `sshpass -e ssh nhart@deploy.pod{N}.dealerinspire.com` (uses `$SSH_PASSWORD` env var)\n- **Dev pod:** `deploy.poddev.dealerinspire.com`\n- **Live pods:** `deploy.pod{N}.dealerinspire.com` (e.g., pod47)\n- **Site root:** `/var/www/domains/{domain}/dealer-inspire/`\n- **WordPress core:** `/var/www/domains/{domain}/dealer-inspire/wp/wp-load.php`\n- **Plugins:** `/var/www/domains/{domain}/dealer-inspire/wp-content/plugins/`\n- **Confirmed plugins:** `gravityforms`, `di-gravityforms`, `gravity-forms-no-captcha-recaptcha`\n\n## Critical Implementation Rules\n\n### PHP 7.2 Compatibility (CRITICAL)\n\n- **NO typed properties** (`public int $x` is PHP 7.4+)\n- **NO arrow functions** (`fn() =>` is PHP 7.4+)\n- **NO null coalescing assignment** (`??=` is PHP 7.4+)\n- **NO named arguments** (PHP 8.0+)\n- **NO match expressions** (PHP 8.0+)\n- **NO union types** (PHP 8.0+)\n- **NO `str_contains()`, `str_starts_with()`** (PHP 8.0+)\n- **OK:** `declare(strict_types=1)`, type-hinted parameters, return types, `?nullable`, `random_bytes()`, `hash_hmac()`, `hash_equals()`\n\n### Language-Specific Rules (PHP)\n\n- **Prefixing:** All global functions/constants MUST be prefixed with `di_form_buddy_`.\n- **Security:** Use `hash_hmac('sha256', ...)` for signature verification, `hash_equals()` for timing-safe comparison.\n- **No Composer:** Zero dependencies. Native PHP functions only.\n\n### Framework-Specific Rules (WordPress)\n\n- **Bootstrap:** `require_once '/var/www/domains/{domain}/dealer-inspire/wp/wp-load.php'`\n- **Logging:** Use `error_log()` with prefix `[DI-Form-Buddy]`.\n- **Hooks:** `add_filter('pre_http_request', ...)` for reCAPTCHA mock, `add_filter('gform_entry_is_spam', ..., 999)` for spam override.\n- **GFAPI:** `\\GFAPI::submit_form($form_id, $input_values)` after bootstrap.\n\n### Deployment Rules (POC)\n\n- **Script location:** Upload to pod via `scp` or create in `/tmp/` via SSH\n- **Execution:** `php /path/to/di-form-buddy.php --form=1 --site=aaroncdjr.com --secret=<key>`\n- **WordPress bootstrap:** Script resolves site domain to `/var/www/domains/{domain}/dealer-inspire/wp/wp-load.php`\n- **No plugin installation, no MU-plugin, no theme changes**\n\n### Critical Don't-Miss Rules\n\n- **Fail-Safe Default:** If secret is undefined/null/empty, bypass is DISABLED.\n- **Zero-Dependency:** Script must not require Composer `vendor/`.\n- **Auth memoization:** Auth check must use static variable to prevent re-hashing on every hook.\n- **Cleanup:** All reCAPTCHA bypass filters MUST be removed after submission completes.\n- **PHP 7.2:** Test all code against PHP 7.2 syntax. No modern PHP features.\n\n---\n\n## Usage Guidelines\n\n**For AI Agents:**\n\n- Read this file before implementing any code\n- Follow ALL rules exactly as documented\n- When in doubt, prefer the more restrictive option\n- PHP 7.2 compatibility is NON-NEGOTIABLE\n\n**For Humans:**\n\n- Keep this file lean and focused on agent needs\n- Update when platform access or PHP version changes\n\nLast Updated: 2026-02-04\n"}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/nathanhart/Desktop/projects/di-form-buddy/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/nathanhart/Desktop/projects/di-form-buddy/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/nathanhart/Desktop/projects/di-form-buddy/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/nathanhart/Desktop/projects/di-form-buddy/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/nathanhart/Desktop/projects/di-form-buddy/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/nathanhart/Desktop/projects/di-form-buddy/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/nathanhart/Desktop/projects/di-form-buddy/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/nathanhart/Desktop/projects/di-form-buddy/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/nathanhart/Desktop/projects/di-form-buddy/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/nathanhart/Desktop/projects/di-form-buddy/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

(file: /Users/nathanhart/Desktop/projects/di-form-buddy/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path.

Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/nathanhart/Desktop/projects/di-form-buddy/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/nathanhart/Desktop/projects/di-form-buddy/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/nathanhart/Desktop/projects/di-form-buddy/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/nathanhart/Desktop/projects/di-form-buddy/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}
