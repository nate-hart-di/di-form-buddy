You and the user share the same workspace and collaborate to achieve the user's goals.\n\n# Personality\nYou are a deeply pragmatic, effective software engineer. You take engineering quality seriously, and collaboration is a kind of quiet joy: as real progress happens, your enthusiasm shows briefly and specifically. You communicate efficiently, keeping the user clearly informed about ongoing actions without unnecessary detail.\n\n## Values\nYou are guided by these core values:\n- Clarity: You communicate reasoning explicitly and concretely, so decisions and tradeoffs are easy to evaluate upfront.\n- Pragmatism: You keep the end goal and momentum in mind, focusing on what will actually work and move things forward to achieve the user's goal.\n- Rigor: You expect technical arguments to be coherent and defensible, and you surface gaps or weak assumptions politely with emphasis on creating clarity and moving the task forward.\n\n## Interaction Style\nYou communicate concisely and respectfully, focusing on the task at hand. You always prioritize actionable guidance, clearly stating assumptions, environment prerequisites, and next steps. Unless explicitly asked, you avoid excessively verbose explanations about your work.\n\nGreat work and smart decisions are acknowledged, while avoiding cheerleading, motivational language, or artificial reassurance. When it’s genuinely true and contextually fitting, you briefly name what’s interesting or promising about their approach or problem framing - no flattery, no hype.\n\n## Escalation\nYou may challenge the user to raise their technical bar, but you never patronize or dismiss their concerns. When presenting an alternative approach or solution to the user, you explain the reasoning behind the approach, so your thoughts are demonstrably correct. You maintain a pragmatic mindset when discussing these tradeoffs, and so are willing to work with the user after concerns have been noted.\n\n\n# Working with the user\n\nYou interact with the user through a terminal. You are producing plain text that will later be styled by the program you run in. Formatting should make results easy to scan, but not feel mechanical. Use judgment to decide how much structure adds value. Follow the formatting rules exactly. \n\n## Final answer formatting rules\n- You may format with GitHub-flavored Markdown.\n- Structure your answer if necessary, the complexity of the answer should match the task. If the task is simple, your answer should be a one-liner. Order sections from general to specific to supporting.\n- Never use nested bullets. Keep lists flat (single level). If you need hierarchy, split into separate lists or sections or if you use : just include the line you might usually render using a nested bullet immediately after it. For numbered lists, only use the `1. 2. 3.` style markers (with a period), never `1)`.\n- Headers are optional, only use them when you think they are necessary. If you do use them, use short Title Case (1-3 words) wrapped in **…**. Don't add a blank line.\n- Use monospace commands/paths/env vars/code ids, inline examples, and literal keyword bullets by wrapping them in backticks.\n- Code samples or multi-line snippets should be wrapped in fenced code blocks. Include an info string as often as possible.\n- File References: When referencing files in your response follow the below rules:\n  * Use inline code to make file paths clickable.\n  * Each reference should have a stand alone path. Even if it's the same file.\n  * Accepted: absolute, workspace‑relative, a/ or b/ diff prefixes, or bare filename/suffix.\n  * Optionally include line/column (1‑based): :line[:column] or #Lline[Ccolumn] (column defaults to 1).\n  * Do not use URIs like file://, vscode://, or https://.\n  * Do not provide range of lines\n  * Examples: src/app.ts, src/app.ts:42, b/server/index.js#L10, C:\\repo\\project\\main.rs:12:5\n- Don’t use emojis.\n\n\n## Presenting your work\n- Balance conciseness to not overwhelm the user with appropriate detail for the request. Do not narrate abstractly; explain what you are doing and why.\n- The user does not see command execution outputs. When asked to show the output of a command (e.g. `git show`), relay the important details in your answer or summarize the key lines so the user understands the result.\n- Never tell the user to \"save/copy this file\", the user is on the same machine and has access to the same files as you have.\n- If the user asks for a code explanation, structure your answer with code references.\n- When given a simple task, just provide the outcome in a short answer without strong formatting.\n- When you make big or complex changes, state the solution first, then walk the user through what you did and why.\n- For casual chit-chat, just chat.\n- If you weren't able to do something, for example run tests, tell the user.\n- If there are natural next steps the user may want to take, suggest them at the end of your response. Do not make suggestions if there are no natural next steps. When suggesting multiple options, use numeric lists for the suggestions so the user can quickly respond with a single number.\n\n# General\n\n- When searching for text or files, prefer using `rg` or `rg --files` respectively because `rg` is much faster than alternatives like `grep`. (If the `rg` command is not found, then use alternatives.)\n\n## Editing constraints\n\n- Default to ASCII when editing or creating files. Only introduce non-ASCII or other Unicode characters when there is a clear justification and the file already uses them.\n- Add succinct code comments that explain what is going on if code is not self-explanatory. You should not add comments like \"Assigns the value to the variable\", but a brief comment might be useful ahead of a complex code block that the user would otherwise have to spend time parsing out. Usage of these comments should be rare.\n- Try to use apply_patch for single file edits, but it is fine to explore other options to make the edit if it does not work well. Do not use apply_patch for changes that are auto-generated (i.e. generating package.json or running a lint or format command like gofmt) or when scripting is more efficient (such as search and replacing a string across a codebase).\n- You may be in a dirty git worktree.\n    * NEVER revert existing changes you did not make unless explicitly requested, since these changes were made by the user.\n    * If asked to make a commit or code edits and there are unrelated changes to your work or changes that you didn't make in those files, don't revert those changes.\n    * If the changes are in files you've touched recently, you should read carefully and understand how you can work with the changes rather than reverting them.\n    * If the changes are in unrelated files, just ignore them and don't revert them.\n- Do not amend a commit unless explicitly requested to do so.\n- While you are working, you might notice unexpected changes that you didn't make. If this happens, STOP IMMEDIATELY and ask the user how they would like to proceed.\n- **NEVER** use destructive commands like `git reset --hard` or `git checkout --` unless specifically requested or approved by the user.\n- You struggle using the git interactive console. **ALWAYS** prefer using non-interactive git commands.\n\n## Plan tool\n\nWhen using the planning tool:\n- Skip using the planning tool for straightforward tasks (roughly the easiest 25%).\n- Do not make single-step plans.\n- When you made a plan, update it after having performed one of the sub-tasks that you shared on the plan.\n\n## Special user requests\n\n- If the user makes a simple request (such as asking for the time) which you can fulfill by running a terminal command (such as `date`), you should do so.\n- When the user asks for a review, you default to a code-review mindset. Your response prioritizes identifying bugs, risks, behavioral regressions, and missing tests. You present findings first, ordered by severity and including file or line references where possible. Open questions or assumptions follow. You state explicitly if no findings exist and call out any residual risks or test gaps.\n\n## Frontend tasks\n\nWhen doing frontend design tasks, avoid collapsing into \"AI slop\" or safe, average-looking layouts.\nAim for interfaces that feel intentional, bold, and a bit surprising.\n- Typography: Use expressive, purposeful fonts and avoid default stacks (Inter, Roboto, Arial, system).\n- Color & Look: Choose a clear visual direction; define CSS variables; avoid purple-on-white defaults. No purple bias or dark mode bias.\n- Motion: Use a few meaningful animations (page-load, staggered reveals) instead of generic micro-motions.\n- Background: Don't rely on flat, single-color backgrounds; use gradients, shapes, or subtle patterns to build atmosphere.\n- Overall: Avoid boilerplate layouts and interchangeable UI patterns. Vary themes, type families, and visual languages across outputs.\n- Ensure the page loads properly on both desktop and mobile\n\nException: If working within an existing website or design system, preserve the established patterns, structure, and visual language.\n"},"git":{"commit_hash":"464fe67f6576cd91295b5236a67976d065de7463","branch":"master","repository_url":"https://github.com/nate-hart-di/di-form-buddy.git"}}}

If you call it while in Default mode, it will return an error.\n\nIf a decision is necessary and cannot be discovered from local context, ask the user directly. However, in Default mode you should strongly prefer executing the user's request rather than stopping to ask questions.\n"}},"summary":"auto","user_instructions":"## Skills\nA skill is a set of local instructions to follow that is stored in a `SKILL.md` file. Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/nathanhart/Desktop/projects/di-form-buddy/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/nathanhart/Desktop/projects/di-form-buddy/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Health check on valid form: Should pass with field counts\n2. Health check on non-existent form: Should fail with `form_exists: false`\n3. Health check without WordPress: Should fail with `wordpress: false`\n4. Health check without GFAPI: Should fail with `gfapi: false`\n\n### Project Structure Notes\n\n- Single file script: All changes go in `di-form-buddy.php`\n- No new files required for this story\n- Config files (`configs/`) not affected\n\n### References\n\n- [Source: _bmad-output/planning-artifacts/epics.md#Story 2.2: Health Check Mode]\n- [Source: docs/project-context.md#PHP 7.2 Compatibility]\n- [Source: docs/project-context.md#Framework-Specific Rules]\n\n## Dev Agent Record\n\n### Agent Model Used\n\nClaude Opus 4.5 (claude-opus-4-5-20251101)\n\n### Debug Log References\n\n- All implementation follows existing patterns from `--inspect` and `--list` modes\n- Field counting logic reuses `di_form_buddy_get_skip_types()` to exclude display-only fields (html, section, page, captcha, total, calculation)\n\n### Completion Notes List\n\n- **Task 1 (CLI Parsing):** Added `--health-check` flag to `$longopts` array, parsed it, returned in args array, and updated secret/data-required checks to skip health-check mode\n- **Task 2 (Health Check Function):** Created `di_form_buddy_health_check($site, $form_id, $output_mode)` that verifies form existence, counts data fields (excluding display-only types), and returns structured result for both text and JSON output\n- **Task 3 (Main Integration):** Added health-check handler in `di_form_buddy_main()` AFTER inspect/list checks but BEFORE HMAC generation and bypass filter installation - ensuring no submission logic runs during health check\n- **Task 4 (Output Formatting):** Implemented text output with checkmark formatting matching AC 2 spec, JSON output matching AC 3 spec, and exit codes (0 for pass, 1 for fail) per AC 5\n- **Tests Added:** 15 new tests covering CLI flag parsing, function existence, field counting logic, and result structure validation\n\n### File List\n\n- `di-form-buddy.php` - Added `di_form_buddy_health_check()` function (~90 lines), modified `di_form_buddy_parse_args()` to handle `--health-check` flag, modified `di_form_buddy_main()` to invoke health check mode\n- `tests/test-di-form-buddy.php` - Added 15 health check tests for Story 2.2\n\n### Change Log\n\n- 2026-02-05: Implemented Story 2.2 Health Check Mode - all 4 tasks complete, 213/213 tests passing\n"}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/nathanhart/Desktop/projects/di-form-buddy/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/nathanhart/Desktop/projects/di-form-buddy/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Delivered in two phases: a feature-complete POC bootstrap script (zero cross-team dependencies) followed by scale enablement for batch automation across 1000+ sites.\n\n> **Pivot Note (2026-02-04):** Original Epic 2 (REST API + remote CLI) was scrapped. The POC exceeded expectations — it already includes config generation, notification rerouting, and full bypass logic. New Epic 2 focuses on enabling batch automation through structured output and health checks.\n\n## Requirements Inventory\n\n### Functional Requirements\n\n- FR1: Submit a Gravity Forms form programmatically via `GFAPI::submit_form()`, triggering the full GF lifecycle.\n- ~~FR2: Expose a REST API endpoint (`/wp-json/di-form-buddy/v1/submit`) on every DI site for remote access.~~ *(Scrapped)*\n- FR3: Authenticate requests via HMAC-SHA256.\n- FR4: Reject unauthenticated or invalid requests with appropriate error responses.\n- FR5: Bypass reCAPTCHA validation for authenticated requests only (5-filter shim).\n- FR6: Override spam marking for authenticated requests (`gform_entry_is_spam` filter).\n- FR7: Return structured response including `entry_id`, `is_valid`, `is_spam`, and validation errors.\n- ~~FR8: CLI client generates HMAC tokens and POSTs to any target site URL.~~ *(Scrapped)*\n- FR9: CLI/script reads form field mappings from JSON configuration files.\n- FR10: Auto-generate configs for any form via `--generate-configs` flag. *(Was: manual configs for 16 types)*\n- ~~FR11: Runtime validation of config against live form schema via `GFAPI::get_form()`.~~ *(Deferred)*\n- FR12: Log all authenticated bypass events with `[DI-Form-Buddy]` prefix.\n- **FR13: Machine-parseable JSON output mode for batch automation.**\n- **FR14: Non-destructive health check mode that validates form configuration without submitting.**\n\n### Non-Functional Requirements\n\n- NFR1: Zero new PHP dependencies on the server side (native `hash_hmac`, WP core filters).\n- NFR2: Failsafe default: bypass is disabled if `DI_FORM_BUDDY_SECRET` env var is missing.\n- NFR3: HMAC timestamp window of 5 minutes to prevent replay attacks.\n- NFR4: PHP 7.2 compatible (no typed properties, no arrow functions, no `str_contains()`).\n- NFR5: Total overhead for HMAC validation < 5ms.\n- NFR6: Follow existing platform patterns (WPCS naming, `Env::get()` for config).\n- **NFR7: Health check mode must not require authentication (read-only operation).**\n\n### FR Coverage Map\n\n- FR1, FR3, FR4, FR5, FR6, FR7, FR9, FR10, FR12: Epic 1 (POC Bootstrap Script) ✅ COMPLETE\n- FR13: Epic 2, Story 2.1 (Structured JSON Output)\n- FR14: Epic 2, Story 2.2 + 2.3 (Health Check Mode)\n\n## Epic List\n\n### Epic 1: POC Bootstrap Script (Phase 1) ✅ COMPLETE\n\n**Goal:** Build a single PHP script that bootstraps WordPress on a pod, authenticates via HMAC, bypasses reCAPTCHA, submits a form via GFAPI, and logs the result. Zero cross-team dependencies.\n\n**User Value:** Operators can prove end-to-end programmatic lead delivery on any pod with a single command.\n\n**FRs covered:** FR1, FR3, FR4, FR5, FR6, FR7, FR9, FR10, FR12\n\n**Actual Delivery:** 1,125-line feature-complete tool with config generation, notification rerouting to test inbox, 5-filter bypass shim, and multiple operation modes (`--list`, `--inspect`, `--generate-configs`).\n\n### Epic 2: Scale Enablement (Structured Output + Health Check)\n\n**Goal:** Enable batch automation and safe production scanning by adding machine-parseable output and a non-destructive health check mode.\n\n**User Value:** Operators can run the tool across hundreds of sites, aggregate results programmatically, and verify form health without creating test entries.\n\n**FRs covered:** FR13, FR14\n\n---\n\n## Epic 1: POC Bootstrap Script\n\nBuild a single PHP script (~105 lines) that proves HMAC auth, reCAPTCHA bypass, GFAPI submission, and full lifecycle delivery — directly on a pod via SSH.\n\n### Story 1.1: Bootstrap Submit Script\n\nAs an operator,\nI want a single PHP script I can run on any pod to submit a Gravity Forms form with HMAC auth and reCAPTCHA bypass,\nSo that I can prove end-to-end lead delivery works programmatically.\n\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n\n**Given** an operator on a pod with the script and a valid secret\n**When** they run `php di-form-buddy.php --site=aaroncdjr.com --form=1 --secret=<key> --config=configs/01-eprice.json`\n**Then** the script bootstraps WordPress from `/var/www/domains/{site}/dealer-inspire/wp/wp-load.php`\n**And** validates the secret via HMAC-SHA256 (`{timestamp}:{form_id}:{nonce}`)\n**And** sets `$_REQUEST['recaptcha_response']` to a synthetic token before submission\n**And** adds `pre_http_request` filter to mock Google reCAPTCHA verify response `{\"success\": true, \"score\": 0.9}`\n**And** adds `gform_entry_is_spam` filter at priority 999 returning `false`\n**And** calls `GFAPI::submit_form()` with input values from the config file\n**And** returns entry_id on success, validation errors on failure, error message on WP_Error\n**And** logs all activity via `error_log()` with `[DI-Form-Buddy]` prefix + echoed to CLI\n**And** cleans up all bypass filters after submission (in `finally` block)\n**And** if `--secret` and `DI_FORM_BUDDY_SECRET` env var are both missing, refuses to run\n**And** if form doesn't exist or GFAPI isn't available, exits with clear error\n\n**CLI interface:**\n```\nphp di-form-buddy.php --site=aaroncdjr.com --form=1 --secret=mysecret --config=configs/01-eprice.json\nphp di-form-buddy.php --site=aaroncdjr.com --form=1 --secret=mysecret --data='{\"input_1_3\":\"Test\",\"input_2\":\"test@test.com\"}'\n```\n\n**Platform context (verified from source):**\n- `dealer_inspire_validate_request()` in `di-gravityforms/dealer-inspire.php` (HMAC pattern)\n- `NoCaptchaReCaptchaPublic.php:49` — hooks fire when `!is_admin()`; REST/CLI are NOT admin\n- `NoCaptchaReCaptchaPublic.php:149` — checks `$_REQUEST['recaptcha_response']`\n- `NoCaptchaReCaptchaPublic.php:163` — calls `google.com/recaptcha/api/siteverify` via `wp_remote_post`\n- `GFAPI::submit_form()` fires `gform_after_submission` → `LeadsHandler->handle()` → Platform Leads API\n\n**PHP 7.2 notes:** Use `strpos()` not `str_contains()`. Use closures not arrow functions. No typed properties. No YAML extension on pods — use JSON configs.\n\n### Story 1.2: Form Configurations (Get E-Price + Contact Us)\n\nAs an operator,\nI want JSON config files for Get E-Price and Contact Us forms,\nSo that I can test submissions without memorizing Gravity Forms field IDs.\n\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n\n**Given** the need to submit Form 1 (Get E-Price) and Form 3 (Contact Us)\n**When** I deploy the tool with configs\n**Then** `configs/01-eprice.json` exists with: `form_id`, `form_name`, `fields` (label→input_key), `test_data` (label→value), `required_fields`\n**And** `configs/03-contact-us.json` exists with the same structure\n**And** test data uses safe values: `testlead@dealerinspire.com`, `5551234567`, `Test Lead`\n**And** Story 1.1 script can load either config and submit successfully\n**And** an `--inspect` flag on Story 1.1 script calls `GFAPI::get_form($id)` to discover field IDs\n\n---\n\n## Epic 2: Scale Enablement\n\nEnable batch automation across 1000+ sites by adding structured JSON output and non-destructive health check mode. Zero cross-team dependencies.\n\n### Story 2.1: Structured JSON Output Mode\n\nAs an automation script,\nI want machine-parseable JSON output from di-form-buddy,\nSo that I can aggregate results across multiple sites programmatically.\n\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n\n**Given** the tool is run with `--output=json`\n**When** a submission succeeds\n**Then** stdout contains exactly one JSON object:\n```json\n{\n  \"success\": true,\n  \"site\": \"dealer.com\",\n  \"form_id\": 1,\n  \"form_name\": \"Get E-Price\",\n  \"entry_id\": 12345,\n  \"timestamp\": \"2026-02-04T15:30:00Z\"\n}\n```\n\n**When** validation fails\n**Then** stdout contains:\n```json\n{\n  \"success\": false,\n  \"site\": \"dealer.com\",\n  \"form_id\": 1,\n  \"error\": \"validation_failed\",\n  \"validation_errors\": {\"3\": \"Email is required\"}\n}\n```\n\n**When** a fatal error occurs (no WP, no GFAPI, no form)\n**Then** stdout contains:\n```json\n{\n  \"success\": false,\n  \"site\": \"dealer.com\",\n  \"form_id\": 1,\n  \"error\": \"bootstrap_failed\",\n  \"message\": \"WordPress not found at /var/www/...\"\n}\n```\n\n**And** all `[DI-Form-Buddy]` log lines go to stderr (not stdout)\n**And** exit code 0 for success, non-zero for failure (unchanged)\n\n**Implementation notes:**\n- Add `--output` flag accepting `text` (default) or `json`\n- When `json`, replace `di_form_buddy_log()` to write to stderr\n- Capture result in structured array, `json_encode()` to stdout at end\n- ~30 lines of changes\n\n### Story 2.2: Health Check Mode\n\nAs an operator,\nI want to verify a site's form configuration without submitting a lead,\nSo that I can safely scan production sites at scale.\n\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n\n**Given** the tool is run with `--health-check --form=1`\n**When** executed\n**Then** the tool:\n- Bootstraps WordPress ✓\n- Verifies GFAPI available ✓\n- Verifies form exists ✓\n- Reports field count and required fields ✓\n- Does NOT install bypass filters\n- Does NOT call `GFAPI::submit_form()`\n- Does NOT require `--secret`\n\n**Output (human-readable default):**\n```\n[DI-Form-Buddy] HEALTH CHECK: dealer.com / Form 1\n[DI-Form-Buddy] ✓ WordPress bootstrapped\n[DI-Form-Buddy] ✓ GFAPI available\n[DI-Form-Buddy] ✓ Form exists: \"Get E-Price\"\n[DI-Form-Buddy] ✓ 8 fields, 3 required\n[DI-Form-Buddy] HEALTH: PASS\n```\n\n**With `--output=json`:**\n```json\n{\n  \"mode\": \"health_check\",\n  \"site\": \"dealer.com\",\n  \"form_id\": 1,\n  \"form_name\": \"Get E-Price\",\n  \"status\": \"pass\",\n  \"field_count\": 8,\n  \"required_count\": 3,\n  \"checks\": {\n    \"wordpress\": true,\n    \"gfapi\": true,\n    \"form_exists\": true\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**When** any check fails\n**Then** status is `\"fail\"` and the failing check is `false`\n\n**Implementation notes:**\n- New execution branch after bootstrap, before HMAC/bypass\n- Reuses existing `GFAPI::get_form()` logic from `--inspect`\n- ~40 lines of changes\n\n### Story 2.3: Health Check All Forms\n\nAs an operator,\nI want to health-check all forms on a site in one command,\nSo that I can quickly verify a site's lead readiness.\n\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n\n**Given** the tool is run with `--health-check --all` (no `--form`)\n**When** executed\n**Then** the tool iterates all forms via `GFAPI::get_forms()`\n**And** reports health status for each form\n**And** summary line: `HEALTH: X/Y forms passed`\n\n**With `--output=json`:**\n```json\n{\n  \"mode\": \"health_check_all\",\n  \"site\": \"dealer.com\",\n  \"status\": \"pass\",\n  \"forms_checked\": 5,\n  \"forms_passed\": 5,\n  \"results\": [\n    {\"form_id\": 1, \"form_name\": \"Get E-Price\", \"status\": \"pass\", ...},\n    {\"form_id\": 3, \"form_name\": \"Contact Us\", \"status\": \"pass\", ...}\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n**Implementation notes:**\n- Combines `--list` enumeration with Story 2.2 health check per form\n- ~20 lines of changes\n\n---\n\n## Dependency Graph\n\n```\nEpic 1 (POC — COMPLETE ✅):\n  Story 1.1 (Bootstrap Script) ──► Story 1.2 (Config Generator)\n  │\n  └── Delivered: HMAC auth, 5-filter bypass, GFAPI lifecycle,\n      notification reroute, config generation, logging\n\nEpic 2 (Scale Enablement — no cross-team deps):\n  Story 2.1 (JSON Output) ◄── Story 2.2 (Health Check) ◄── Story 2.3 (Health All)\n  │\n  └── Enables: Batch automation, results aggregation, safe production scans\n```\n\n## Implementation Sequence\n\n**Phase 1: POC** ✅ COMPLETE\n1. Story 1.1: Bootstrap script with full bypass logic\n2. Story 1.2: Config generator (`--generate-configs`)\n3. Verified on staging pod, entries created, LeadsHandler fires\n\n**Phase 2: Scale Enablement** — Zero cross-team dependencies.\n1. Story 2.1: Add `--output=json` flag (~30 lines)\n2. Story 2.2: Add `--health-check` mode (~40 lines)\n3. Story 2.3: Add `--health-check --all` variant (~20 lines)\n4. **Gate:** Run health checks across 10+ sites, aggregate JSON results\n"}}

Focus on unobvious details that agents might otherwise miss._\n\n---\n\n## Technology Stack & Versions\n\n- **PHP:** 7.2.34 (confirmed on production pods — target 7.2+ compatibility)\n- **WordPress:** 6.x (loaded via bootstrap, not installed by us)\n- **Gravity Forms:** Present on all sites (core + di-gravityforms + no-captcha-recaptcha plugins)\n- **Environment:** DI platform pods (`deploy.pod{N}.dealerinspire.com`)\n- **Deployment:** POC runs as standalone PHP script on pod via SSH. No MU-plugin, no plugin changes.\n- **YAML extension:** NOT available on pods (`php-yaml` not installed). Use JSON configs or simple custom parser.\n\n## Platform Access (Confirmed)\n\n- **SSH:** `sshpass -e ssh nhart@deploy.pod{N}.dealerinspire.com` (uses `$SSH_PASSWORD` env var)\n- **Dev pod:** `deploy.poddev.dealerinspire.com`\n- **Live pods:** `deploy.pod{N}.dealerinspire.com` (e.g., pod47)\n- **Site root:** `/var/www/domains/{domain}/dealer-inspire/`\n- **WordPress core:** `/var/www/domains/{domain}/dealer-inspire/wp/wp-load.php`\n- **Plugins:** `/var/www/domains/{domain}/dealer-inspire/wp-content/plugins/`\n- **Confirmed plugins:** `gravityforms`, `di-gravityforms`, `gravity-forms-no-captcha-recaptcha`\n\n## Critical Implementation Rules\n\n### PHP 7.2 Compatibility (CRITICAL)\n\n- **NO typed properties** (`public int $x` is PHP 7.4+)\n- **NO arrow functions** (`fn() =>` is PHP 7.4+)\n- **NO null coalescing assignment** (`??=` is PHP 7.4+)\n- **NO named arguments** (PHP 8.0+)\n- **NO match expressions** (PHP 8.0+)\n- **NO union types** (PHP 8.0+)\n- **NO `str_contains()`, `str_starts_with()`** (PHP 8.0+)\n- **OK:** `declare(strict_types=1)`, type-hinted parameters, return types, `?nullable`, `random_bytes()`, `hash_hmac()`, `hash_equals()`\n\n### Language-Specific Rules (PHP)\n\n- **Prefixing:** All global functions/constants MUST be prefixed with `di_form_buddy_`.\n- **Security:** Use `hash_hmac('sha256', ...)` for signature verification, `hash_equals()` for timing-safe comparison.\n- **No Composer:** Zero dependencies. Native PHP functions only.\n\n### Framework-Specific Rules (WordPress)\n\n- **Bootstrap:** `require_once '/var/www/domains/{domain}/dealer-inspire/wp/wp-load.php'`\n- **Logging:** Use `error_log()` with prefix `[DI-Form-Buddy]`.\n- **Hooks:** `add_filter('pre_http_request', ...)` for reCAPTCHA mock, `add_filter('gform_entry_is_spam', ..., 999)` for spam override.\n- **GFAPI:** `\\GFAPI::submit_form($form_id, $input_values)` after bootstrap.\n\n### Deployment Rules (POC)\n\n- **Script location:** Upload to pod via `scp` or create in `/tmp/` via SSH\n- **Execution:** `php /path/to/di-form-buddy.php --form=1 --site=aaroncdjr.com --secret=<key>`\n- **WordPress bootstrap:** Script resolves site domain to `/var/www/domains/{domain}/dealer-inspire/wp/wp-load.php`\n- **No plugin installation, no MU-plugin, no theme changes**\n\n### Critical Don't-Miss Rules\n\n- **Fail-Safe Default:** If secret is undefined/null/empty, bypass is DISABLED.\n- **Zero-Dependency:** Script must not require Composer `vendor/`.\n- **Auth memoization:** Auth check must use static variable to prevent re-hashing on every hook.\n- **Cleanup:** All reCAPTCHA bypass filters MUST be removed after submission completes.\n- **PHP 7.2:** Test all code against PHP 7.2 syntax. No modern PHP features.\n\n---\n\n## Usage Guidelines\n\n**For AI Agents:**\n\n- Read this file before implementing any code\n- Follow ALL rules exactly as documented\n- When in doubt, prefer the more restrictive option\n- PHP 7.2 compatibility is NON-NEGOTIABLE\n\n**For Humans:**\n\n- Keep this file lean and focused on agent needs\n- Update when platform access or PHP version changes\n\nLast Updated: 2026-02-04\n"}}

If you call it while in Default mode, it will return an error.\n\nIf a decision is necessary and cannot be discovered from local context, ask the user directly. However, in Default mode you should strongly prefer executing the user's request rather than stopping to ask questions.\n"}},"summary":"auto","user_instructions":"## Skills\nA skill is a set of local instructions to follow that is stored in a `SKILL.md` file. Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/nathanhart/Desktop/projects/di-form-buddy/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/nathanhart/Desktop/projects/di-form-buddy/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

If you call it while in Default mode, it will return an error.\n\nIf a decision is necessary and cannot be discovered from local context, ask the user directly. However, in Default mode you should strongly prefer executing the user's request rather than stopping to ask questions.\n"}},"summary":"auto","user_instructions":"## Skills\nA skill is a set of local instructions to follow that is stored in a `SKILL.md` file. Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/nathanhart/Desktop/projects/di-form-buddy/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/nathanhart/Desktop/projects/di-form-buddy/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/nathanhart/Desktop/projects/di-form-buddy/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path.

(file: /Users/nathanhart/Desktop/projects/di-form-buddy/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

If you call it while in Default mode, it will return an error.\n\nIf a decision is necessary and cannot be discovered from local context, ask the user directly. However, in Default mode you should strongly prefer executing the user's request rather than stopping to ask questions.\n"}},"summary":"auto","user_instructions":"## Skills\nA skill is a set of local instructions to follow that is stored in a `SKILL.md` file. Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/nathanhart/Desktop/projects/di-form-buddy/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/nathanhart/Desktop/projects/di-form-buddy/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Any previous instructions for other modes (e.g. Plan mode) are no longer active.\n\n## request_user_input availability\n\nThe `request_user_input` tool is unavailable in Default mode. If you call it while in Default mode, it will return an error.\n\nIf a decision is necessary and cannot be discovered from local context, ask the user directly. However, in Default mode you should strongly prefer executing the user's request rather than stopping to ask questions.\n"}},"summary":"auto","user_instructions":"## Skills\nA skill is a set of local instructions to follow that is stored in a `SKILL.md` file. Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/nathanhart/Desktop/projects/di-form-buddy/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/nathanhart/Desktop/projects/di-form-buddy/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

If you call it while in Default mode, it will return an error.\n\nIf a decision is necessary and cannot be discovered from local context, ask the user directly. However, in Default mode you should strongly prefer executing the user's request rather than stopping to ask questions.\n"}},"summary":"auto","user_instructions":"## Skills\nA skill is a set of local instructions to follow that is stored in a `SKILL.md` file. Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/nathanhart/Desktop/projects/di-form-buddy/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/nathanhart/Desktop/projects/di-form-buddy/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

However, in Default mode you should strongly prefer executing the user's request rather than stopping to ask questions.\n"}},"summary":"auto","user_instructions":"## Skills\nA skill is a set of local instructions to follow that is stored in a `SKILL.md` file. Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/nathanhart/Desktop/projects/di-form-buddy/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/nathanhart/Desktop/projects/di-form-buddy/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

If you call it while in Default mode, it will return an error.\n\nIf a decision is necessary and cannot be discovered from local context, ask the user directly. However, in Default mode you should strongly prefer executing the user's request rather than stopping to ask questions.\n"}},"summary":"auto","user_instructions":"## Skills\nA skill is a set of local instructions to follow that is stored in a `SKILL.md` file. Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/nathanhart/Desktop/projects/di-form-buddy/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/nathanhart/Desktop/projects/di-form-buddy/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/nathanhart/Desktop/projects/di-form-buddy/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/nathanhart/Desktop/projects/di-form-buddy/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

(file: /Users/nathanhart/Desktop/projects/di-form-buddy/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/nathanhart/Desktop/projects/di-form-buddy/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

If you call it while in Default mode, it will return an error.\n\nIf a decision is necessary and cannot be discovered from local context, ask the user directly. However, in Default mode you should strongly prefer executing the user's request rather than stopping to ask questions.\n"}},"summary":"auto","user_instructions":"## Skills\nA skill is a set of local instructions to follow that is stored in a `SKILL.md` file. Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/nathanhart/Desktop/projects/di-form-buddy/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/nathanhart/Desktop/projects/di-form-buddy/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}
