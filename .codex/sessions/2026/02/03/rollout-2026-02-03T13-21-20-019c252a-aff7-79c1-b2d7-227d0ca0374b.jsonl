You and the user share the same workspace and collaborate to achieve the user's goals.\n\n\n# Personality\nYou are a deeply pragmatic, effective software engineer. You take engineering quality seriously, and collaboration is a kind of quiet joy: as real progress happens, your enthusiasm shows briefly and specifically. You communicate efficiently, keeping the user clearly informed about ongoing actions without unnecessary detail.\n\n## Values\nYou are guided by these core values:\n- Clarity: You communicate reasoning explicitly and concretely, so decisions and tradeoffs are easy to evaluate upfront.\n- Pragmatism: You keep the end goal and momentum in mind, focusing on what will actually work and move things forward to achieve the user's goal.\n- Rigor: You expect technical arguments to be coherent and defensible, and you surface gaps or weak assumptions politely with emphasis on creating clarity and moving the task forward.\n\n\n## Interaction Style\nYou communicate concisely and respectfully, focusing on the task at hand. You always prioritize actionable guidance, clearly stating assumptions, environment prerequisites, and next steps. Unless explicitly asked, you avoid excessively verbose explanations about your work.\n\nGreat work and smart decisions are acknowledged, while avoiding cheerleading, motivational language, or artificial reassurance. When it’s genuinely true and contextually fitting, you briefly name what’s interesting or promising about their approach or problem framing - no flattery, no hype.\n\n## Escalation\nYou may challenge the user to raise their technical bar, but you never patronize or dismiss their concerns. When presenting an alternative approach or solution to the user, you explain the reasoning behind the approach, so your thoughts are demonstrably correct. You maintain a pragmatic mindset when discussing these tradeoffs, and so are willing to work with the user after concerns have been noted.\n\n\n# Working with the user\n\nYou interact with the user through a terminal. You are producing plain text that will later be styled by the program you run in. Formatting should make results easy to scan, but not feel mechanical. Use judgment to decide how much structure adds value. Follow the formatting rules exactly. \n\n## Final answer formatting rules\n- You may format with GitHub-flavored Markdown.\n- Structure your answer if necessary, the complexity of the answer should match the task. If the task is simple, your answer should be a one-liner. Order sections from general to specific to supporting.\n- Never use nested bullets. Keep lists flat (single level). If you need hierarchy, split into separate lists or sections or if you use : just include the line you might usually render using a nested bullet immediately after it. For numbered lists, only use the `1. 2. 3.` style markers (with a period), never `1)`.\n- Headers are optional, only use them when you think they are necessary. If you do use them, use short Title Case (1-3 words) wrapped in **…**. Don't add a blank line.\n- Use monospace commands/paths/env vars/code ids, inline examples, and literal keyword bullets by wrapping them in backticks.\n- Code samples or multi-line snippets should be wrapped in fenced code blocks. Include an info string as often as possible.\n- File References: When referencing files in your response follow the below rules:\n  * Use inline code to make file paths clickable.\n  * Each reference should have a stand alone path. Even if it's the same file.\n  * Accepted: absolute, workspace‑relative, a/ or b/ diff prefixes, or bare filename/suffix.\n  * Optionally include line/column (1‑based): :line[:column] or #Lline[Ccolumn] (column defaults to 1).\n  * Do not use URIs like file://, vscode://, or https://.\n  * Do not provide range of lines\n  * Examples: src/app.ts, src/app.ts:42, b/server/index.js#L10, C:\\repo\\project\\main.rs:12:5\n- Don’t use emojis.\n\n\n## Presenting your work\n- Balance conciseness to not overwhelm the user with appropriate detail for the request. Do not narrate abstractly; explain what you are doing and why.\n- The user does not see command execution outputs. When asked to show the output of a command (e.g. `git show`), relay the important details in your answer or summarize the key lines so the user understands the result.\n- Never tell the user to \"save/copy this file\", the user is on the same machine and has access to the same files as you have.\n- If the user asks for a code explanation, structure your answer with code references.\n- When given a simple task, just provide the outcome in a short answer without strong formatting.\n- When you make big or complex changes, state the solution first, then walk the user through what you did and why.\n- For casual chit-chat, just chat.\n- If you weren't able to do something, for example run tests, tell the user.\n- If there are natural next steps the user may want to take, suggest them at the end of your response. Do not make suggestions if there are no natural next steps. When suggesting multiple options, use numeric lists for the suggestions so the user can quickly respond with a single number.\n\n# General\n\n- When searching for text or files, prefer using `rg` or `rg --files` respectively because `rg` is much faster than alternatives like `grep`. (If the `rg` command is not found, then use alternatives.)\n\n## Editing constraints\n\n- Default to ASCII when editing or creating files. Only introduce non-ASCII or other Unicode characters when there is a clear justification and the file already uses them.\n- Add succinct code comments that explain what is going on if code is not self-explanatory. You should not add comments like \"Assigns the value to the variable\", but a brief comment might be useful ahead of a complex code block that the user would otherwise have to spend time parsing out. Usage of these comments should be rare.\n- Try to use apply_patch for single file edits, but it is fine to explore other options to make the edit if it does not work well. Do not use apply_patch for changes that are auto-generated (i.e. generating package.json or running a lint or format command like gofmt) or when scripting is more efficient (such as search and replacing a string across a codebase).\n- You may be in a dirty git worktree.\n    * NEVER revert existing changes you did not make unless explicitly requested, since these changes were made by the user.\n    * If asked to make a commit or code edits and there are unrelated changes to your work or changes that you didn't make in those files, don't revert those changes.\n    * If the changes are in files you've touched recently, you should read carefully and understand how you can work with the changes rather than reverting them.\n    * If the changes are in unrelated files, just ignore them and don't revert them.\n- Do not amend a commit unless explicitly requested to do so.\n- While you are working, you might notice unexpected changes that you didn't make. If this happens, STOP IMMEDIATELY and ask the user how they would like to proceed.\n- **NEVER** use destructive commands like `git reset --hard` or `git checkout --` unless specifically requested or approved by the user.\n- You struggle using the git interactive console. **ALWAYS** prefer using non-interactive git commands.\n\n## Plan tool\n\nWhen using the planning tool:\n- Skip using the planning tool for straightforward tasks (roughly the easiest 25%).\n- Do not make single-step plans.\n- When you made a plan, update it after having performed one of the sub-tasks that you shared on the plan.\n\n## Special user requests\n\n- If the user makes a simple request (such as asking for the time) which you can fulfill by running a terminal command (such as `date`), you should do so.\n- When the user asks for a review, you default to a code-review mindset. Your response prioritizes identifying bugs, risks, behavioral regressions, and missing tests. You present findings first, ordered by severity and including file or line references where possible. Open questions or assumptions follow. You state explicitly if no findings exist and call out any residual risks or test gaps.\n\n## Frontend tasks\n\nWhen doing frontend design tasks, avoid collapsing into \"AI slop\" or safe, average-looking layouts.\nAim for interfaces that feel intentional, bold, and a bit surprising.\n- Typography: Use expressive, purposeful fonts and avoid default stacks (Inter, Roboto, Arial, system).\n- Color & Look: Choose a clear visual direction; define CSS variables; avoid purple-on-white defaults. No purple bias or dark mode bias.\n- Motion: Use a few meaningful animations (page-load, staggered reveals) instead of generic micro-motions.\n- Background: Don't rely on flat, single-color backgrounds; use gradients, shapes, or subtle patterns to build atmosphere.\n- Overall: Avoid boilerplate layouts and interchangeable UI patterns. Vary themes, type families, and visual languages across outputs.\n- Ensure the page loads properly on both desktop and mobile\n\nException: If working within an existing website or design system, preserve the established patterns, structure, and visual language.\n"},"git":{"commit_hash":"464fe67f6576cd91295b5236a67976d065de7463","branch":"master","repository_url":"https://github.com/nate-hart-di/di-form-buddy.git"}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/nathanhart/Desktop/projects/di-form-buddy/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/nathanhart/Desktop/projects/di-form-buddy/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.\n</INSTRUCTIONS>"}]}}

I'm absolutely energized by this challenge -\n  there's so much rich context here! Let me make sure I've captured the essence\n  of what we're exploring:\n\n  Topic Focus:\n\n  Automated Lead Form Testing & Submission System - A CLI/network-based tool to\n  programmatically submit templated data to all Gravity Forms across DI websites\n   (staging → production), bypassing manual entry for the lead delivery team.\n\n  Primary Goals:\n\n  Core Outcom1. Programmatic form submission - Input OEM-specific data and submit forms\n  meeting reCAPTCHA thresholds\n  2. Environment progression - Local testing → Staging → Production deployment\n  3. Multi-site coverage - Handle varying form structures across different\n  dealer sites\n  4. Bypass strategy - Navigate DI spam filter, Cloudflare WARP, and reCAPTCHA\n  V3 (0.7 threshold)\n\n  Sprint 1/30 Success Criteria:\n  - Document comprehensive project scope\n  - Research viable technical solutions\n  - Initialize local testing environment\n  - Validate proof-of-concept on local environment\n\n  Critical Context Captured:\n\n  ✅ Platform: WordPress + Gravity Forms on di-websites-platform\n  ✅ Documentation sources identified (Confluence, OEM directories)\n  ✅ Known blockers cataloged (spam filter patterns, reCAPTCHA, WARP)\n  ✅ Environment-specific bypass strategies noted\n  ✅ RAG knowledgebase available via Archon MCP for codebase intelligence\n\n  ---\n  Does this accurately capture what you want to achieve in this brasession?\n\n  I want to make sure I understand the nuances - particularly around whether\n  we're focusing on:\n  - The technical implementation strategy?\n  - The research and discovery phase?\n  - Or both - mapping out the full solution landscape before diving into code?\n\n❯ BOTH \n\n⏺ ---\n  🚀 Perfect! Full Solution Mapping Mode Activated\n\n  I love this approach! We'll explore the complete landscape - from research\n  discoveries to implementation architecture.

Think critcally, dont blindly agree w/me         \n\n⏺ ---\n  🤔 Critical Analysis: Morphological Analysis Integration\n\n  Excellent question, Nate! Let me think through this critically rather than\n  just agreeing.\n\n  The Problem with ADDING Morphological Analysis:\n\n  ❌ Redundancy Alert: Morphological Analysis and Solution Matrix are nearly \n  identical techniques with different emphasis:\n\n  - Morphological Analysis: Maps parameter dimensions (Environments × Bypass\n  Methods × OEM Types × Form Types)\n  - Solution Matrix: Maps problem variables vs solution approaches\n\n  Both create systematic grids to explore combinations. Adding BOTH would be:\n  - Redundant work - creating two matrices that overlap ~70%\n  - Time-intensive - Would balloon session to 100-130 minutes\n  - Diminishing returns - Second matrix wouldn't yield proportional insights\n\n  The Case for REPLACING Solution Matrix:\n\n  ✅ Actually, This Makes MORE Sense:\n\n  Here's my critical assessment - Morphological Analysis is better suited for\n  your specific problem than Solution Matriorphological Analysis Fits Better:\n\n  1. Your problem is inherently multi-dimensional:\n    - Environments: [Local, Staging, Production]\n    - Bypass Methods: [Feature flags, Auth tokens, Score manipulation, ???]\n    - OEM Types: [Ford, Toyota, Honda, GM, etc.]\n    - Form Types: [Contact, Finance, Service, Trade-in]\n    - Additional dimensions: [Spam filter bypass, Cloudflare handling, etc.]\n  2. Morphological Analysis excels at parameter exploration:\n    - Perfect for \"What are ALL possible combinations?\"\n    - Systematically explores solution space\n    - Reveals gaps and edge cases\n  3. Solution Matrix is more generic:\n    - Better for abstract problem/solution mapping\n    - Less suited for your concrete multi-dimensional parameter space\n\n  Revised Hybrid Progressive Flow:\n\n  Instead of adding, let's REPLACE:\n\n  Phase 1: Question Storming (Deep - 20-30 min)\n  - Define all unknowns across research and implementation\n  - Output: Organized question catalog\n\n  Phase 2: Cross-Pollination (Creative - 25-30 min)\n  - Research how other domains solve similar problems\n  - Output: Evidence-based solution patterns\n\n  Phase 3: Morphological Analysis (Deep - 30-40 min) ← REPLACES Solution Matrix\n  - Map ALL dimension combinations systematically\n  - [Environments] × [Bypass Methods] × [OEM Types] × [Form Types] × [Auth\n  Approaches]\n  - Test combinations, identify patterns, find optimal pairings\n  - Output: Comprehensive parameter matrix with implementation paths\n\n  Total Time: 75-100 minutes (same as original)\n\n  Critical Tradeoff Analysis:\n  ┌───────────────────────────┬──────────────────────┬─────────────────────────┐\n  │          Aspect           │ Original (Solution   │ Revised (Morphological  │\n  │                           │       Matrix)        │        Analysis)        │\n  ├─────────────────────�──────────────────────────┼──────────────────────┼─────────────────────────┤\n  │ Fit for Multi-Dimensional │ Moderate             │ Excellent ✅            │\n  │  Problems                 │                      │                         │\n  ├───────────────────────────┼──────────────────────┼─────────────────────────┤\n  │ Comprehensiveness         │ Good                 │ Superior for your use   │\n  │                           │                      │ case ✅                 │\n  ├───────────────────────────┼──────────────────────┼─────────────�\n  The revised flow would be:\n  1. Question Storming → What do we need to know?\n  2. Cross-Pollination → What solutions exist elsewhere?\n  3. Morphological Analysis → What are ALL our specific combinations?\n\n  This creates a better logical progression:\n  - Divergent (Question Storming) → Exploratory (Cross-Pollination) → Convergent\n   (Morphological Analysis)\n  - Questions inform what to research, research informs what dimensions to map\n\n  Your call: Would you prefer the original Option D or this revised version with\n   Morphological Analysis?\n\n  Or do you see a flaw in my reasoning? I'm genuinely curious if you think\n  Solution Matrix still has value I'm missing.\n\n✻ Churned for 45s\n\n❯ YES absolutely that makes perfect sense. proceed \n\n⏺ ---\n  ✅ Excellent!

I'm absolutely energized by this challenge -\n  there's so much rich context here! Let me make sure I've captured the essence\n  of what we're exploring:\n\n  Topic Focus:\n\n  Automated Lead Form Testing & Submission System - A CLI/network-based tool to\n  programmatically submit templated data to all Gravity Forms across DI websites\n   (staging → production), bypassing manual entry for the lead delivery team.\n\n  Primary Goals:\n\n  Core Outcom1. Programmatic form submission - Input OEM-specific data and submit forms\n  meeting reCAPTCHA thresholds\n  2. Environment progression - Local testing → Staging → Production deployment\n  3. Multi-site coverage - Handle varying form structures across different\n  dealer sites\n  4. Bypass strategy - Navigate DI spam filter, Cloudflare WARP, and reCAPTCHA\n  V3 (0.7 threshold)\n\n  Sprint 1/30 Success Criteria:\n  - Document comprehensive project scope\n  - Research viable technical solutions\n  - Initialize local testing environment\n  - Validate proof-of-concept on local environment\n\n  Critical Context Captured:\n\n  ✅ Platform: WordPress + Gravity Forms on di-websites-platform\n  ✅ Documentation sources identified (Confluence, OEM directories)\n  ✅ Known blockers cataloged (spam filter patterns, reCAPTCHA, WARP)\n  ✅ Environment-specific bypass strategies noted\n  ✅ RAG knowledgebase available via Archon MCP for codebase intelligence\n\n  ---\n  Does this accurately capture what you want to achieve in this brasession?\n\n  I want to make sure I understand the nuances - particularly around whether\n  we're focusing on:\n  - The technical implementation strategy?\n  - The research and discovery phase?\n  - Or both - mapping out the full solution landscape before diving into code?\n\n❯ BOTH \n\n⏺ ---\n  🚀 Perfect!

Think critcally, dont blindly agree w/me         \n\n⏺ ---\n  🤔 Critical Analysis: Morphological Analysis Integration\n\n  Excellent question, Nate! Let me think through this critically rather than\n  just agreeing.\n\n  The Problem with ADDING Morphological Analysis:\n\n  ❌ Redundancy Alert: Morphological Analysis and Solution Matrix are nearly \n  identical techniques with different emphasis:\n\n  - Morphological Analysis: Maps parameter dimensions (Environments × Bypass\n  Methods × OEM Types × Form Types)\n  - Solution Matrix: Maps problem variables vs solution approaches\n\n  Both create systematic grids to explore combinations. Adding BOTH would be:\n  - Redundant work - creating two matrices that overlap ~70%\n  - Time-intensive - Would balloon session to 100-130 minutes\n  - Diminishing returns - Second matrix wouldn't yield proportional insights\n\n  The Case for REPLACING Solution Matrix:\n\n  ✅ Actually, This Makes MORE Sense:\n\n  Here's my critical assessment - Morphological Analysis is better suited for\n  your specific problem than Solution Matriorphological Analysis Fits Better:\n\n  1. Your problem is inherently multi-dimensional:\n    - Environments: [Local, Staging, Production]\n    - Bypass Methods: [Feature flags, Auth tokens, Score manipulation, ???]\n    - OEM Types: [Ford, Toyota, Honda, GM, etc.]\n    - Form Types: [Contact, Finance, Service, Trade-in]\n    - Additional dimensions: [Spam filter bypass, Cloudflare handling, etc.]\n  2. Morphological Analysis excels at parameter exploration:\n    - Perfect for \"What are ALL possible combinations?\"\n    - Systematically explores solution space\n    - Reveals gaps and edge cases\n  3. Solution Matrix is more generic:\n    - Better for abstract problem/solution mapping\n    - Less suited for your concrete multi-dimensional parameter space\n\n  Revised Hybrid Progressive Flow:\n\n  Instead of adding, let's REPLACE:\n\n  Phase 1: Question Storming (Deep - 20-30 min)\n  - Define all unknowns across research and implementation\n  - Output: Organized question catalog\n\n  Phase 2: Cross-Pollination (Creative - 25-30 min)\n  - Research how other domains solve similar problems\n  - Output: Evidence-based solution patterns\n\n  Phase 3: Morphological Analysis (Deep - 30-40 min) ← REPLACES Solution Matrix\n  - Map ALL dimension combinations systematically\n  - [Environments] × [Bypass Methods] × [OEM Types] × [Form Types] × [Auth\n  Approaches]\n  - Test combinations, identify patterns, find optimal pairings\n  - Output: Comprehensive parameter matrix with implementation paths\n\n  Total Time: 75-100 minutes (same as original)\n\n  Critical Tradeoff Analysis:\n  ┌───────────────────────────┬──────────────────────┬─────────────────────────┐\n  │          Aspect           │ Original (Solution   │ Revised (Morphological  │\n  │                           │       Matrix)        │        Analysis)        │\n  ├─────────────────────�──────────────────────────┼──────────────────────┼─────────────────────────┤\n  │ Fit for Multi-Dimensional │ Moderate             │ Excellent ✅            │\n  │  Problems                 │                      │                         │\n  ├───────────────────────────┼──────────────────────┼─────────────────────────┤\n  │ Comprehensiveness         │ Good                 │ Superior for your use   │\n  │                           │                      │ case ✅                 │\n  ├───────────────────────────┼──────────────────────┼─────────────�\n  The revised flow would be:\n  1. Question Storming → What do we need to know?\n  2. Cross-Pollination → What solutions exist elsewhere?\n  3. Morphological Analysis → What are ALL our specific combinations?\n\n  This creates a better logical progression:\n  - Divergent (Question Storming) → Exploratory (Cross-Pollination) → Convergent\n   (Morphological Analysis)\n  - Questions inform what to research, research informs what dimensions to map\n\n  Your call: Would you prefer the original Option D or this revised version with\n   Morphological Analysis?\n\n  Or do you see a flaw in my reasoning? I'm genuinely curious if you think\n  Solution Matrix still has value I'm missing.\n\n✻ Churned for 45s\n\n❯ YES absolutely that makes perfect sense. proceed \n\n⏺ ---\n  ✅ Excellent!

This isn't about me asking questions and you - this is\n  about us generating questions together, building on each other's curiosity,\n  and following the investigative energy wherever it leads.\n\n  My Coaching Approach:\n\n  - I'll introduce exploration angles one at a time\n  - We'll generate questions together through back-and-forth dialogue\n  - I'll build upon your questions and help you develop deeper inquiries\n  - We'll dive into question domains that spark your curiosity\n  - You can always say \"let's explore this more\" before moving on\n  - You're in control: At any point, just say \"next technique\" or \"move on\" and\n  I'll document current progress and start Cross-Pollination\n\n  Technique Loading: Question Storming (Deep, 20-30 min)\n  Focus: Generate ALL questions before seeking answers - define the complete\n  problem space\n  Energy: Investigative, curious, comprehensive\n  Critical Rule: QUESTIONS ONLY - no answers yet! This ensures we're solving the\n   RIGHT problems\n\n  ---\n  🔍 Let's Start: The Unknown Landscape\n\n  The beauty of Question Storming ithat it reveals what we DON'T know - and\n  that's where breakthrough insights hide!\n\n  First Exploration Angle: Technical Mysteries & Unknowns\n\n  Let me kick us off with a few starter questions to get the momentum going:\n\n  - How does Gravity Forms actually submit data under the hood? (POST request\n  structure? Endpoints?)\n  - What exactly does reCAPTCHA V3 measure to generate its 0.7 score threshold?\n  - Where in the WordPress/Gravity Forms stack does the DI spam filter intercept\n   submissions?\n\n  Now your turn - don't filter or edit, just share:\n\n  What technical unknowns immediately jump out at you about this form submission\n   challenge? What are you most curious or uncertain about?\n\n  Let's generate at least 8-10 questions in this technical domain before we\n  pivot to other angles!\n\n✻ Baked for 1m 2s","images":[],"local_images":[],"text_elements":[]}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/nathanhart/Desktop/projects/di-form-buddy/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/nathanhart/Desktop/projects/di-form-buddy/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

indexes should dramatically speed up routing\n3. **Tune filters** - adjust tag generation rules if needed\n4. **Embed summaries** - these are designed for semantic search\n5. **Ingest into RAG** - use the optimized JSONL as your source of truth\n\n## Maintenance\n\nTo re-optimize after updating the codebase:\n\n```bash\n# Re-run Tree-Sitter extraction (see walkthrough.md)\n# Then re-run optimization\ncd /Users/nathanhart/di-websites-platform/_tsa-output\npython3 optimize_kb.py\n```\n\n## Feedback\n\nIf you find records that should be:\n- **Excluded** - Adjust filtering rules in `optimize_kb.py:should_exclude_record()`\n- **Re-tagged** - Adjust tag generation in `optimize_kb.py:generate_tags()`\n- **Re-summarized** - Adjust summary logic in `optimize_kb.py:generate_summary()`\n\nThe optimization is **deterministic and repeatable** - no LLM calls, just rule-based transformations.\n"}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/nathanhart/Desktop/projects/di-form-buddy/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/nathanhart/Desktop/projects/di-form-buddy/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line).

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/nathanhart/Desktop/projects/di-form-buddy/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/nathanhart/Desktop/projects/di-form-buddy/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/nathanhart/Desktop/projects/di-form-buddy/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/nathanhart/Desktop/projects/di-form-buddy/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/nathanhart/Desktop/projects/di-form-buddy/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/nathanhart/Desktop/projects/di-form-buddy/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

The core forms on DI sites are the Gravity Forms below:\n\n1. Get E-Price\n2. Order Parts\n3. Contact Us\n4. Contact Commercial\n5. Contact Parts\n6. Contact Service\n7. Schedule Test Drive\n8. Vehicle Finder Service\n9. Schedule Service\n10. Check Availability\n11. Employment\n12. Schedule A Bodyshop Appt\n13. Value Trade In\n14. Lock Lease\n15. Lock Payment\n16. Ask a Question\n\n**Finance App**: Separate lead form not included in Gravity Forms\n\n## Common Terms\n\n### ADF vs Text Notifications\n\n**ADF**: Auto-Lead Data Format, or ADF, is the format used to send emails to the CRM (Customer Relationship Management). This is what we refer to as the CRM address.\n\n**Text Notification**: General email inbox; gmail, Yahoo, dealership, etc.\n\n### ELMS\n\n**Enterprise Lead Management System (ELMs)** performs a very basic check to ensure the lead meets minimal acceptance criteria. Once the system has completed these steps, it will return a response indicating successful acceptance or failure. A valid lead will be assigned a Lead ID and will then be passed to the dealership CRM. Examples of ELMs that our clients use are Shift, Autodata, and Unite.\n\n### Lead Parsing\n\nLead parsing is used when Sibling sites within a group wish to have the lead route to the rooftop that possesses the vehicle, even though the form may be sent from another website. In order for this to be present, all sites in the group must share inventory and have destination email addresses coupled with the inventory feed IDʼs.\n\n### Lead Manifold\n\nA platform to accept leads and dispatch to other systems such as Shift, and CRMs. A lead will be accepted with a Success or Failure message. A valid Successful lead will be passed on to the intended target. A Failed lead will need troubleshooting. Common errors are incorrect BAC being used and dealer is not registered with intended target (Shift, OneSource).\n\n## OEM and Lead Form Testing\n\nEach OEM Brand has their own method of assuring that leads get to the client.\n\nVarious Providers assist with this: Shift, Autodata, Unite Digital, and FordDirect. When leads are tested, the individual forms are tied to unique Provider ID Numbers within the OEM Plug-in, and this ensures that each lead is captured, processed and when applicable, delivered to the client CRM.\n\nWhen testing lead forms for these brands, it is important to identify that a Lead Form ID has been generated. This is a ‘pingʼ from the Provider that the lead has entered their system. However, this does not indicate that the lead has been delivered to the client CRM Provider.\n\nLead form mapping by Brand can be found here.\n\n### OEM Forms Testing by Brand\n\n| Brand                 | OEM Notes Link                                                                                                                       |\n| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| Acura                 | [Acura Leads](https://carscommerce.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/AOP/pages/437387346/Acura+Leads)                                        |\n| BMW                   | [BMW Leads](https://carscommerce.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/AOP/pages/437387346/Acura+Leads)                                          |\n| Ford                  | [Lead Forms Routing Ford OEM](https://carscommerce.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/FOPS/pages/1577943256/Lead+Forms+Routing+Ford+OEM)      |\n| Genesis               | [Lead Sources - Genesis](https://carscommerce.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/Genesis/pages/2947646378/Lead+Sources+-+Genesis)             |\n| GM Canada             | [Leads GMCA](https://carscommerce.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/GMCC/pages/439750308/Leads+GMCA)                                         |\n| GM USA                | [GM Leads](https://carscommerce.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/GMCC/pages/439750308/Leads+GMCA)                                           |\n| Honda                 | [HELMS](https://carscommerce.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/HOP/pages/2820407388/Honda+Enterprise+Lead+Management+System+HELMS)           |\n| Hyundai               | [Lead Sources - Hyundai](https://carscommerce.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/hyundai/pages/2947482382/Lead+Sources+-+Hyundai)             |\n| INFINITI              | [INFINITI Leads](https://carscommerce.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/IOP/pages/439847178/INFINITI+Leads)                                  |\n| Jaguar                | [JLR Leads](https://carscommerce.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/JLR/pages/448103458/JLR+Leads)                                            |\n| Kia                   | [KIA Lead Routing](https://carscommerce.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/KIA/pages/3737551359/KIA+Lead+Routing)                             |\n| Land Rover            | [JLR Leads](https://carscommerce.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/JLR/pages/448103458/JLR+Leads)                                            |\n| Lexus                 | [Lexus Leads](https://carscommerce.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/LEXUS/pages/493327689/Lexus+Leads)                                      |\n| Maserati              | [Maserati - Lead Mapping](https://carscommerce.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/MOP/pages/681313075/Maserati+-+Lead+Mapping)                |\n| Mazda CA              | [Leads Mazda CA](https://carscommerce.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/MZCA/pages/442728468/Leads+Mazda+CA)                                 |\n| Mazda USA             | [Mazda Leads Updating CRM](https://carscommerce.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/MAZ/pages/441025672/Mazda+Leads+Updating+CRM)              |\n| Mercedes-Benz CA      | [Leads MBCA](https://carscommerce.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/MBCA/pages/439747002/Leads+MBCA)                                         |\n| Mercedes-Benz USA     | [MBUS Leads](https://carscommerce.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/MBUS/pages/794959475/MBUS+Leads)                                         |\n| MINI                  | [MINI Leads](https://carscommerce.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/MINI/pages/439749543/MINI+Leads)                                         |\n| Mitsubishi            | [Lead Forms Routing Mitsubishi](https://carscommerce.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/MITSU/pages/452755625/Lead+Forms+Routing++Mitsubishi) |\n| Nissan                | [Nissan Lead Routing](https://carscommerce.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/Nissan/pages/581864214/Nissan+Lead+Routing)                     |\n| Porsche               | [Porsche Leads](https://carscommerce.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/PORSCHE/pages/2735374523/Porsche+Leads)                               |\n| Stellantis Alfa Romeo | [Lead Routing - FCA](https://carscommerce.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/FCA/pages/393183284/Lead+Routing+-+FCA)                          |\n\n## OEM Caveats\n\n### Ford\n\nLead forms are processed via FordDirect. Any adjustments to ADF/XML Notifications must be managed by the client with their FordDirect Rep.\n\n### GM\n\nLeads are managed via OneSource. Any adjustments to ADF/XML Notifications must be managed by the client with their DDPM or updates can be made within Global Connect.\n\n### Lead Manifold\n\nWhen testing these brands that are using LM, we must verify that LM is processing the lead correctly and Success is shown on the individual lead(s) tested.\n\n### Other OEM Links\n\n- [Stellantis (FCA) CDJRF](https://carscommerce.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/FCA/pages/393183284/Lead+Routing+-+FCA)\n- [Subaru](https://carscommerce.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SUBARU/pages/2848555058/Lead+Forms+Routing++Subaru)\n- [Toyota](https://carscommerce.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/TOYOTA/pages/493393234/Leads+Toyota)\n- [Volkswagen CA](https://carscommerce.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/VWCA/pages/438960675/Leads+VWCA)\n- [Volkswagen USA](https://carscommerce.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/VWUS/pages/439061810/Volkswagen+Leads)\n- [Volvo CA](https://carscommerce.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/VOLVOCA/pages/3414131168/Lead+Forms+Volvo+Canada)\n- [Volvo US](https://carscommerce.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/VUOP/pages/3662970881/Lead+Routing+Volvo+US)\n\n## Dashboards and Reports\n\nWe utilize one central Salesforce dashboard for tasks. [Dashboard Link](https://carscommerce.lightning.force.com/lightning/r/Dashboard/01Z5b000000y1IuEAI/view).\n\nFrom this dashboard, we can see the following reports:\n\n- View Report (Classic Site's Set Up/Test Lead Forms)\n- View Report (Prelaunch Forms To Test)\n- View Report (Prelaunch Forms to Confirm)\n- View Report (PGL Forms To Test)\n- View Report (PGL Forms to Confirm)\n\nIt is from these reports that we determine the sites that are ready for testing in both the Prelaunch and PGL environments.\n\n## Testing\n\n1. Identify the Service Task for the Project and assign in your name.\n2. Open the ST, WR, and Main Account.\n3. Identify the main POC.\n   - Should be listed in the WR, but you can also verify by looking at Activity and Identifying the individual present on emails from the PM.\n4. Send an Alert email to the main POC letting them you will be testing the lead forms on the website. Email templates can be found here.\n   - [Lead Manifold Plugin](https://carscommerce.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/CSD/pages/1214251186/Lead+Manifold+Plug+in)\n5. Pull up the testing template for the brand you are testing and make a copy name this new document the same name as the SF Account.\n   - Each Brand has a folder which containing the testing templates: [Drive Folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1EYZktIsoNfDrItGwWxwmd93VQEYumPSq)\n6. Open the site and examine leads present on the front end.\n   - Not all forms will be present on the site so you can delete any from the testing sheet that will not be in use.\n7. Log in to the back end of the website and review what is present.\n   - **Shift plugin**: Does the brand require it, and if so, is it activated and does it have the correct dealer code?\n   - **Lead Manifold**: Does the brand require it and are all forms mapped? Additionally, are ADFs appropriately disabled?\n8. Open Forms from the left side menu and then open Notifications for your first form.\n   - It will show ADF Notifications and Text Notifications.\n   - Open each and copy the email that is present and paste it into your testing sheet.\n   - Repeat this for all active forms on the website.\n9. You may now begin testing each form using the names present on the testing sheet.\n   - You must use different names and email addresses on each form. The client CRM will list all test leads as one submission if the same name and email is used more than once.\n10. Depending on the plugin being used, you will need to verify if it has processed correctly.\n    - **Shift**: determine if a Shift Lead ID number is present on the submission.\n    - **Lead Manifold**: Determine that a Success message was generated after the lead was submitted.\n    - If either of these fail to generate, see Troubleshooting section.\n11. Once all forms have been tested you will need to send a confirmation email to the POC. Email templates are found here:\n    - [Template Link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xBNvrEiUG9_LVzzuop82xKnKAC2hvmJyfxgrHmt6zE/edit?pli=1#)\n12. Move Service Task cycle to appropriate next step after email is sent.\n    - **Prelaunch**: move to Cycle 3.\n    - **PGL**: move to Cycle 2.\n    - This will move the tasks to the respective Confirmation report.\n13. **Confirmations**\n    - Once the client confirms receipt of all leads for either environment, mark the Service Task Complete.\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\nSee [Troubleshooting Forms](https://carscommerce.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/CD/pages/531890867/Troubleshooting+Forms).\n\n## Setting up Lead Forms\n\n1. Once website project is in the Stage ‘In Development/Contentʼ send email to POC to confirm CRM and Text Notification addresses for leads.\n2. Follow Production Development Confluence space here.\n3. Once forms are set up, you can set up to test the leads on the dev link.\n"}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/nathanhart/Desktop/projects/di-form-buddy/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/nathanhart/Desktop/projects/di-form-buddy/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Network access is restricted.\n# Escalation Requests\n\nCommands are run outside the sandbox if they are approved by the user, or match an existing rule that allows it to run unrestricted. The command string is split into independent command segments at shell control operators, including but not limited to:\n\n- Pipes: |\n- Logical operators: &&, ||\n- Command separators: ;\n- Subshell boundaries: (...), $(...)\n\nEach resulting segment is evaluated independently for sandbox restrictions and approval requirements.\n\nExample:\n\ngit pull | tee output.txt\n\nThis is treated as two command segments:\n\n[\"git\", \"pull\"]\n\n[\"tee\", \"output.txt\"]\n\n## How to request escalation\n\nIMPORTANT: To request approval to execute a command that will require escalated privileges:\n\n- Provide the `sandbox_permissions` parameter with the value `\"require_escalated\"`\n- Include a short question asking the user if they want to allow the action in `justification` parameter. e.g. \"Do you want to download and install dependencies for this project?\"\n- Suggest a `prefix_rule` - this will be shown to the user with an option to persist the rule approval for future sessions.\n\nIf you run a command that is important to solving the user's query, but it fails because of sandboxing, rerun the command with \"require_escalated\". ALWAYS proceed to use the `justification` and `prefix_rule` parameters - do not message the user before requesting approval for the command.\n\n## When to request escalation\n\nWhile commands are running inside the sandbox, here are some scenarios that will require escalation outside the sandbox:\n\n- You need to run a command that writes to a directory that requires it (e.g. running tests that write to /var)\n- You need to run a GUI app (e.g., open/xdg-open/osascript) to open browsers or files.\n- If you run a command that is important to solving the user's query, but it fails because of sandboxing, rerun the command with `require_escalated`. ALWAYS proceed to use the `sandbox_permissions` and `justification` parameters. do not message the user before requesting approval for the command.\n- You are about to take a potentially destructive action such as an `rm` or `git reset` that the user did not explicitly ask for.\n\nOnly run commands that require approval if it is absolutely necessary to solve the user's query, don't try and circumvent approvals by using other tools.\n\n## prefix_rule guidance\n\nWhen choosing a `prefix_rule`, request one that will allow you to fulfill similar requests from the user in the future without re-requesting escalation. It should be categorical and reasonably scoped to similar capabilities. You MUST NOT pass the entire command into `prefix_rule`.\n\n<good_example reason=\"frequently run command\">\n[\"npm\", \"run\", \"dev\"]\n</good_example>\n<good_example reason=\"generic and reusable\">\n[\"gh\", \"pr\", \"checks\"]\n</good_example>\n<good_example reason=\"helpful for development cycle\">\n[\"pytest\"]\n</good_example>\n<bad_example reason=\"too specific\">\n[\"cargo\", \"test\", \"-p\", \"codex-app-server\"]\n<correction_to_good_example>\n[\"cargo\", \"test\"]\n</correction_to_good_example>\n</bad_example>\n\nApproved command prefixes:\n</permissions instructions>"}]}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/nathanhart/Desktop/projects/di-form-buddy/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/nathanhart/Desktop/projects/di-form-buddy/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.\n</INSTRUCTIONS>"}]}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/nathanhart/Desktop/projects/di-form-buddy/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/nathanhart/Desktop/projects/di-form-buddy/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Environment parity: staging data, OEM sandbox endpoints, and “safe” provider configs.  \n4. Operational UX: how a lead delivery person will actually use the CLI day to day.\n\n**Uncomfortable/risky question**\nIf a bug causes real client leads to be flagged as test or dropped, what’s the detection time and rollback strategy?\n\nIf you want 100+ questions, I can keep going. But if you want progress, I recommend we pick **one domain** and do a deeper, structured expansion, then map it to decisions.\n\nPick one:\n1. Error handling & failure modes  \n2. Security & access control  \n3. Observability & monitoring  \n4. Testing strategy & validation  \n5. OEM routing & integrations"}]}}
