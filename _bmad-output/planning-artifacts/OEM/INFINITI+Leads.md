| **Where do these forms map through? ** _Do they use Shift, Unite Digital, Autodata, etc?_                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Shift                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| **Does this brand route credit apps through the OEM?** _If yes, please provide that mapping. Does this brand capture credit app info and how is that passed? Shift and dealer, Autodata only, etc_                                                                                                  | No                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Shift has a dedicated source for dealers that uses a DI website credit app form. This lead source should route through Shift. Any information that is being passed to Shift would pass to the dealer in the lead notes outside of basic contact information. Source ID 131, 'DI - Finance Pre Qual' |
| **What are the form testing requirements?** _What are their specific naming conventions or testing rules when we are testing leads or a new form. If there are not specific form testing requirements, please put “No form testing requirements.”_                                                  | Using the word ‘Test’ in any information of a test lead would result in the lead not going past the Shift system. If a real name is used but is for testing purposes, an email should be sent to the Shift infobox (info@infinitidigitalprogram.com) so that the lead can be invalidated. Any lead that is sent in for testing should be confirmed by the Shift program rep or infobox to confirm the lead routing is set up properly. |

| **Does this brand have any custom forms besides the core 1-16?** if yes, please provide the form title, provider ID, and mapping. _All sites go through development with the core #1-16 forms (Contact Us, Get E-Price, etc), does this brand have any specific forms that are required past thes
<truncated 903 bytes>
n-oem feeds to route to their specific OEM’s and bypass the OEM? Or do ALL leads need to route to the OEM, regardless of brand or feed?_ | This has been allowed in the past. Requests can be evaluated/approved via Shift - [info@infinitidigitalprogram.com](mailto:info@infinitidigitalprogram.com).  
 |
| **Does this brand have any custom form requirements/notes?** _Please provide clear details. Stellantis for example requires a zipcode field on all forms and this cannot be removed, does your brand have any similar requirements or rules we need to be aware of?_ | Custom forms should be approved by Shift as INFINITI incentivizes dealers based on certain lead data. If there is another approved form that can be used rather than a custom form, the OEM prefers those be used. For approval, please reach out to the INFINITI Infobox ([info@infinitidigitalprogram.com](mailto:info@infinitidigitalprogram.com)) and the [ITS rep](https://carscommerce.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/IOP/pages/4319379992). The OEM requires either phone or email for any form. |
| **Buy/Sell and forms** _How are forms tested or updated when a site goes through a buy/sell? Are live site updates allowed?_  
_When is a new dealer code activated based on the buy/sell sale?_  
_Anything else form specific to know about Buy/Sells?_ | Shift will submit test leads on the live site after the updated dealer code has been processed throughout the website. A new dealer code will be activated after getting official notice from the IRDMP team. Nothing else to note, Shift will be in contact if there are any issues. |
| **Additional Support Notes** | In addition to being sent to Shift Digital, leads with non-INFINITI used vehicles will also be sent directly to the Dealer.

**Form PII:**  
It is a requirement that INFINITI sites can only keep personal info on leads for 30 days. Please keep this in mind. Form Entries on INFINITI sites older than 30 days will soon be missing name, phone, email; anything that personally identifies someone.
