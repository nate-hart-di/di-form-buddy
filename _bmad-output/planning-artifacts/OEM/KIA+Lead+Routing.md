| **Does this brand have any custom forms besides the core 1-16? if yes, please provide the form title, provider ID, and mapping.** _All sites go through development with the core #1-16 forms (Contact Us, Get E-Price, etc), does this brand have any specific forms that are required past these core 16? If so, what are they and how are they used on the site?_ | No |
| **What is the mapping ID and mapping type for each form?** _For example, are the forms mapped as shift and dealer? Dealer only?_ | |
| **Does this brand allow custom used lead routing? Please elaborate on if yes or no. Is this up to date?** [OEM ROUTING APPROVAL](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BZAqkFxH9KZCAP4wbXftBWUiaN-Swf1lb2ozno3fOfI/edit#gid=0) _Some dealers share inventory for multiple sites and they want routing to be updated based on inventory feeds._  
_For example, if a MINI site also has their BMW and CDJR inventory feeds, can we update routing on the non-oem feeds to route to their specific OEM’s and bypass the OEM? Or do ALL leads need to route to the OEM, regardless of brand or feed?_ | No. Kia does not permit non Kia stores to be routed through to the inventory feed. |
